  abstract = {Technical variation plays an important role in microarray-based gene expression studies, and batch effects explain a large proportion of this noise. It is therefore mandatory to eliminate technical variation while maintaining biological variability. Several strategies have been proposed for the removal of batch effects, although they have not been evaluated in large-scale longitudinal gene expression data. In this study, we aimed at identifying a suitable method for batch effect removal in a large study of microarray-based longitudinal gene expression. Monocytic gene expression was measured in 1092 participants of the Gutenberg Health Study at baseline and 5-year follow up. Replicates of selected samples were measured at both time points to identify technical variability. Deming regression, Passing-Bablok regression, linear mixed models, non-linear models as well as ReplicateRUV and ComBat were applied to eliminate batch effects between replicates. In a second step, quantile normalization prior to batch effect correction was performed for each method. Technical variation between batches was evaluated by principal component analysis. Associations between body mass index and transcriptomes were calculated before and after batch removal. Results from association analyses were compared to evaluate maintenance of biological variability. Quantile normalization, separately performed in each batch, combined with ComBat successfully reduced batch effects and maintained biological variability. ReplicateRUV performed perfectly in the replicate data subset of the study, but failed when applied to all samples. All other methods did not substantially reduce batch effects in the replicate data subset. Quantile normalization plus ComBat appears to be a valuable approach for batch correction in longitudinal gene expression data.},

Multi-sample global normalization methods, such as quantile normalization, have been successfully used to remove technical variation from noisy data.

Transforming the data to remove these differences has the potential to remove interesting biologically driven global variation and therefore may not be appropriate depending on the type and source of variation. Currently, it is up to the subject matter experts, for example biologists, to determine if the stated assumptions are appropriate or not. Here, we propose a data-driven method to test for the assumptions of global normalization methods. We demonstrate the utility of our method (quantro), by applying it to multiple gene expression and DNA methylation and show examples of when global normalization methods are not appropriate. We also perform a Monte Carlo simulation study to illustrate how our method generally outperforms the current approach.

\textbf{Abstract}

These methods rely on the assumption that observed global changes across samples are due to unwanted technical variability. Transforming the data to remove these differences has the potential to remove interesting biologically driven global variation and therefore may not be appropriate depending on the type and source of variation.

\textbf{Main Text}

\begin{itemize}

\item Using house-keeping genes to normalize did not work. 

\item Hypothesis of most techniques: Assume observed variability in global properties are due to only technical reasons and are unrelated to biology of interest.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item Total \# of DE genes across groups

\item Median gene expression across genes

\item Statistical distribution of gene expression values

\end{itemize}

\textbf{If a substantially higher percentage of genes are expected to be expressed in only one group of samples, it may not be appropriate to use global adjustment methods. }}

It is generally inappropriate to combine datasets without adjusting for batch effects.

\textbf{Model / Algorithm}

Assumes batch effects can be modeled out by standardizing means and variances across batches. Adjustments can be gene-wise standardization to complex linear / non-linear adjustments.

\textbf{L/S Model (Location/Scale, which means mean/variance)}

Y\_ijg = a\_g + X * B\_g + y\_ig + delta\_ig * epsilon\_ijg

Y\_ijg = Counts for gene g, sample j, batch i

a\_g = overall gene expression for gene g

X = design matrix for sample conditions

B\_g~ = Vector of regression coefficients corresponding to X

y\_ig = Additive batch effects of batch i for gene g

delta\_ig = Multiplicative batch effects of batch gene g

epsilon\_ijg = Error term following a normal distribution w/ expected value of zero and

\textbf{Steps}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Standardize the data}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Standardize the data gene-wise so genes have similar mean and variance. This corrects for magnitude of expression values, which for RNA-seq is sequencing depth.

\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{EB batch effect parameter estimates using parametric emprical priors}

\item \textbf{Adjust the data for batch effects}

  abstract = {The expression microarray is a frequently used approach to study gene expression on a genome-wide scale. However, the data produced by the thousands of microarray studies published annually are confounded by ``batch effects,'' the systematic error introduced when samples are processed in multiple batches. Although batch effects can be reduced by careful experimental design, they cannot be eliminated unless the whole study is done in a single batch. A number of programs are now available to adjust microarray data for batch effects prior to analysis. We systematically evaluated six of these programs using multiple measures of precision, accuracy and overall performance. ComBat, an Empirical Bayes method, outperformed the other five programs by most metrics. We also showed that it is essential to standardize expression data at the probe level when testing for correlation of expression profiles, due to a sizeable probe effect in microarray data that can inflate the correlation among replicates and unrelated samples.},

Projecting as an evolutionary step, following the transition from mainframe computers to client/server deployment models, cloud computing encompasses elements from grid computing, utility computing and autonomic computing, into an innovative deployment architecture. This rapid transition towards the clouds, has fuelled concerns on a critical issue for the success of information systems, communication and information security. From a security perspective, a number of unchartered risks and challenges have been introduced from this relocation to the clouds, deteriorating much of the effectiveness of traditional protection mechanisms. As a result the aim of this paper is twofold; firstly to evaluate cloud security by identifying unique security requirements and secondly to attempt to present a viable solution that eliminates these potential threats. This paper proposes introducing a Trusted Third Party, tasked with assuring specific security characteristics within a cloud environment. The proposed solution calls upon cryptography, specifically Public Key Infrastructure operating in concert with SSO and LDAP, to ensure the authentication, integrity and confidentiality of involved data and communications. The solution, presents a horizontal level of service, available to all implicated entities, that realizes a security mesh, within which essential trust is maintained.},

  abstract = {Genomic data is growing exponentially due to next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) and their ability to produce massive amounts of data in a short time. NGS technologies generate big genomic data that needs to be exchanged between different locations efficiently and reliably. The current network transfer protocols rely on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Data gram Protocol (UDP) protocols, ignoring data size and type. Universal application layer protocols such as HTTP are designed for wide variety of data types and are not particularly efficient for genomic data. Therefore, we present a new data-aware transfer protocol for genomic-data that increases network throughput and reduces latency, called Genomic Text Transfer Protocol (GTTP). In this paper, we design and implement a new network transfer protocol for big genomic DNA dataset that relies on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Modification to content-encoding of HTTP has been done that would transfer big genomic DNA datasets using machine-to-machine (M2M) and client(s)-server topologies. Our results show that our modification to HTTP reduces the transmitted data by 75\% of original data and still be able to regenerate the data at the client side for bioinformatics analysis. Consequently, the transfer of data using GTTP is shown to be much faster (about 8 times faster than HTTP) when compared with regular HTTP.},

  abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS\textemdash{}the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases\textemdash{}make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

  abstract = {Detection of somatic point substitutions is a key step in characterizing the cancer genome. However, existing methods typically miss low-allelic-fraction mutations that occur in only a subset of the sequenced cells owing to either tumor heterogeneity or contamination by normal cells. Here we present MuTect, a method that applies a Bayesian classifier to detect somatic mutations with very low allele fractions, requiring only a few supporting reads, followed by carefully tuned filters that ensure high specificity. We also describe benchmarking approaches that use real, rather than simulated, sequencing data to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity as a function of sequencing depth, base quality and allelic fraction. Compared with other methods, MuTect has higher sensitivity with similar specificity, especially for mutations with allelic fractions as low as 0.1 and below, making MuTect particularly useful for studying cancer subclones and their evolution in standard exome and genome sequencing data.

This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered tracks. Text and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site databases. One-half of the annotation tracks are computed at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available sequence data; collaborators worldwide provide the rest. Users can stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational or research purposes. The conceptual and technical framework of the browser, its underlying MYSQL database, and overall use are described.

  abstract = {A new and conceptually simple data structure, called a suffix array, for on-line string searches is introduced in this paper. Constructing and querying suffix arrays is reduced to a sort and search paradigm that employs novel algorithms. The main advantage of suffix arrays over suffix trees is that, in practice, they use three to five times less space. From a complexity standpoint, suffix arrays permit on-line string searches of the type, ``Is W a substring of A?'' to be answered in time \$O(P + $\backslash$log N)\$, where P is the length of W and N is the length of A, which is competitive with (and in some cases slightly better than) suffix trees. The only drawback is that in those instances where the underlying alphabet is finite and small, suffix trees can be constructed in \$O(N)\$ time in the worst case, versus \$O(N$\backslash$log N)\$ time for suffix arrays. However, an augmented algorithm is given that, regardless of the alphabet size, constructs suffix arrays in \$O(N)\$expected time, albeit with lesser space efficiency. It is believed that suffix arrays will prove to be better in practice than suffix trees for many applications.},

Here, we show that usual normalization approaches mostly account for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library preparation and other more complex unwanted technical effects. We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.},

  abstract = {Estimation of structure, such as in variable selection, graphical modelling or cluster analysis is notoriously difficult, especially for high-dimensional data. We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high-dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularisation for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for randomised Lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions needed for consistency of the original Lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

  abstract = {Cell surface proteins are major targets of biomedical research due to their utility as cellular markers and their extracellular accessibility for pharmacological intervention. However, information about the cell surface protein repertoire (the surfaceome) of individual cells is only sparsely available. Here, we applied the Cell Surface Capture (CSC) technology to 41 human and 31 mouse cell types to generate a mass-spectrometry derived Cell Surface Protein Atlas (CSPA) providing cellular surfaceome snapshots at high resolution. The CSPA is presented in form of an easy-to-navigate interactive database, a downloadable data matrix and with tools for targeted surfaceome rediscovery (http://wlab.ethz.ch/cspa). The cellular surfaceome snapshots of different cell types, including cancer cells, resulted in a combined dataset of 1492 human and 1296 mouse cell surface glycoproteins, providing experimental evidence for their cell surface expression on different cell types, including 136 G-protein coupled receptors and 75 membrane receptor tyrosine-protein kinases. Integrated analysis of the CSPA reveals that the concerted biological function of individual cell types is mainly guided by quantitative rather than qualitative surfaceome differences. The CSPA will be useful for the evaluation of drug targets, for the improved classification of cell types and for a better understanding of the surfaceome and its concerted biological functions in complex signaling microenvironments.},

  doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btp692},
  abstract = {Motivation: RNA-Seq is a promising new technology for accurately measuring gene expression levels. Expression estimation with RNA-Seq requires the mapping of relatively short sequencing reads to a reference genome or transcript set. Because reads are generally shorter than transcripts from which they are derived, a single read may map to multiple genes and isoforms, complicating expression analyses. Previous computational methods either discard reads that map to multiple locations or allocate them to genes heuristically., Results: We present a generative statistical model and associated inference methods that handle read mapping uncertainty in a principled manner. Through simulations parameterized by real RNA-Seq data, we show that our method is more accurate than previous methods. Our improved accuracy is the result of handling read mapping uncertainty with a statistical model and the estimation of gene expression levels as the sum of isoform expression levels. Unlike previous methods, our method is capable of modeling non-uniform read distributions. Simulations with our method indicate that a read length of 20\textendash{}25 bases is optimal for gene-level expression estimation from mouse and maize RNA-Seq data when sequencing throughput is fixed., Availability: An initial C++ implementation of our method that was used for the results presented in this article is available at http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/rsem., Contact: cdewey@biostat.wisc.edu, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics on},

Androgen receptor (AR) activity varied widely and in a subtype-specific manner, with SPOP and FOXA1 mutant tumors having the highest levels of AR-induced transcripts. 25\% of the prostate cancers had a presumed actionable lesion in the PI3K or MAPK signaling pathways, and DNA repair genes were inactivated in 19\%.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Expression of CD70, a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, is restricted to activated T and B lymphocytes and mature dendritic cells. CD70 has also been detected on hematological tumors and on carcinomas. The restricted expression pattern of CD70 in normal tissues and its widespread expression in various malignancies makes it an attractive target for antibody-based therapeutics. Investigations to exploit CD70 as a cancer target have lead to the identification of potential antibody-based clinical candidates. Anti-CD70 antibodies for therapeutic use have been developed and used to validate CD70 as a target for cancers. Antibodies are also used as a vehicle to deliver potent cytotoxic drugs to target CD70+ malignant cells. Both unconjugated antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates targeting CD70 have been tested in animal models of human cancers.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the expression of CD70 in cancer cells and the development of antibody-based therapies against CD70.
METHODS: A review of the available literature.
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Humanized anti-CD70 antibodies have shown significant antitumor activity in preclinical xenograft models of cancer. Additionally, anti-CD70 antibody-drug conjugates exhibit potent antitumor activity in solid tumor xenograft models, confirming increased therapeutic efficacy through cytotoxic drug delivery. Thus, preclinical animal models have provided strong evidence that targeting CD70 either with unconjugated antibodies or with antibody-drug conjugates represents a promising approach to treat human malignancies.},

  abstract = {Genomic characterization used in pediatric cancer clinical trials is limited to the detection of somatic mutations and gene fusions in well-characterized cancer genes. However, these approaches do not reveal actionable therapeutic targets for the majority of pediatric cancer patients. Incorporation of gene expression information into clinical genomic analysis is hindered by the lack of appropriate computational methods, designed for single patients rather than patient cohorts. UC Santa Cruz Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative (treehousegenomics.soe.ucsc.edu) enables the incorporation of gene expression information into the genomic evaluation of pediatric cancer patients. We leverage large cancer RNA sequencing datasets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas, Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments, Medulloblastoma Advanced Genomics International Consortium, International Cancer Genome Consortium, and published research and clinical studies. Through our ``pan-cancer analysis'', we compare each prospective tumor's RNA sequencing and/or mutational profile to over 11,000 uniformly analyzed tumor profiles using our Tumor Map method. Tumor Map visualizes single tumors together with the reference compendium and identifies samples that are most similar to the given tumor based on the gene expression profiles. We also developed a gene expression outlier analysis to identify transcripts that are over expressed in the given tumor. These pan-cancer gene expression analyses are used in conjunction with mutation data to nominate molecular pathways that may be driving the disease in each child, providing useful information to the medical teams. We aim to evaluate this approach in partnership with pediatric cancer clinical genomic trials at Stanford University, UC San Francisco, Children's Hospital of Orange County, University of Michigan, Children's Mercy Hospital, and British Columbia Children's Hospital. The analysis of the first 27 patients at Stanford, most with refractory solid tumors, provided evidence of the potential clinical utility of incorporating gene expression information into the genomic evaluation of pediatric cancer patients. In all cases, we identified candidate driver molecular pathways that could be targeted by existing FDA-approved therapies or therapies available through a clinical trial. The most frequently identified molecular targets were receptor tyrosine kinases and cyclin-dependent kinases. For 3 patients with no treatment options prior to our work, the analysis contributed to treatment decisions. This study provides a framework for incorporating gene expression information into the clinical interpretation of pediatric cancer genomic data. We underscore the importance of releasing the data to the community immediately following generation, so that they may benefit new patients.

  abstract = {Purpose: A phase I peptide vaccination trial was done in patients with progressive cytokine-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to assess both the toxicity and capability to induce immune responses of three peptides (CA9p219-227, p288-296, and p323-331) derived from CA9, a tumor-associated antigen ubiquitously expressed in RCC.
Experimental Design: Twenty-three patients positive for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A24 with histologically confirmed RCC were enrolled. Eligibility included progressive disease after standard cytokine therapy with interleukin-2 and/or IFN-$\alpha$. Patients were vaccinated s.c. with the three peptides emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 2-week intervals. Pre- and post-vaccination blood samples were obtained for toxicity assessment and immunologic studies. Patients were monitored for clinical responses on a 3-monthly basis.
Results: Vaccinations were well tolerated without any major adverse event. Most of the patients developed peptide-specific CTLs and/or immunoglobulin G reactive to the peptides after the 6th or 9th vaccination, followed by a gradual increase in both CTL frequency and levels of peptide-reactive serum IgG. Three patients with multiple lung metastases showed partial responses with disappearance and shrinking of metastatic lesions. Additionally, stable disease for $>$6 months was observed in six patients (median duration, 12.2 months). Moreover, the median survival time of all patients who were progressive at trial enrollment after failing immunotherapy was 21.0 months (5-35 months).
Conclusions: These results suggest that vaccination of these peptides is safe and recommended for further trials for HLA-A24-positive metastatic RCC patients.},

Here we focus on the problem of detecting gene fusions from raw sequencing data, assembling the reads to define fusion transcripts and their associated breakpoints, and quantifying their abundances. Building on the pseudoalignment idea that simplifies and accelerates transcript quantification, we introduce a novel approach to fusion detection based on inspecting paired reads that cannot be pseudoaligned due to conflicting matches. The method and software, called pizzly, filters false positives, assembles new transcripts from the fusion reads, and reports candidate fusions. With pizzly, fusion detection from raw RNA-Seq reads can be performed in a matter of minutes, making the program suitable for the analysis of large cancer gene expression databases and for clinical use. pizzly is available at https://github.com/pmelsted/pizzly},

Antibodies of distinct specificities were coated on very small areas in close proximity forming matrix-like arrays on glass cover slips. These antibody spots were found to be capable of serving as minute specific immunoadsorbents for cells bearing on their surface the antigens with which the antibodies reacted. Antibody spots of 1.0, 0.5 and 0.25 mm diameter could adsorb maximally about 17,000, 4500, and 1100 mononuclear cells. An area of 1 cm2 could be coated with 25, 100, or 400 of these spots, respectively. In matrixes that contained anti-Lyt 2.1 and anti-Lyt 2.2 antibody spots, AKR (Lyt 2.1+) thymocytes adhered only to anti-Lyt 2.1 spots, BALB/c (Lyt 2.2+) thymocytes only to anti-Lyt 2.2 spots, and thymocytes of (AKR \texttimes{} BALB/c) F1 to both spots. The potential of this method for determining allotypes of HLA antigens and for determining in a mixed cell population the proportions of subsets bearing specific differentiation antigens is discussed.},

Many different experimental features can cause biases including different sources of RNA, different production lots of microarrays or different microarray platforms. These systematic effects present a substantial hurdle to the analysis of microarray data.Results: We present here a new method for the identification and adjustment of systematic biases that are present within microarray data sets. Our approach is based on modern statistical discrimination methods and is shown to be very effective in removing systematic biases present in a previously published breast tumor cDNA microarray data set. The new method of `Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD)' is shown to be better than Support Vector Machines and Singular Value Decomposition for the adjustment of systematic microarray effects. In addition, it is shown to be of general use as a tool for the discrimination of systematic problems present in microarray data sets, including the merging of two breast tumor data sets completed on different microarray platforms.Availability: Matlab software to perform DWD can be retrieved from https://genome.unc.edu/pubsup/dwd/Supplementary information: The complete figures that represent the cluster diagrams in Figure 6 and other figures are available at https://genome.unc.edu/pubsup/dwd/},

The analysis of such experiments is nontrivial because of large data size and many levels of variation introduced at different stages of the experiments. The analysis is further complicated by the large differences that may exist among different probes used to interrogate the same gene. However, an attractive feature of high-density oligonucleotide arrays such as those produced by photolithography and inkjet technology is the standardization of chip manufacturing and hybridization process. As a result, probe-specific biases, although significant, are highly reproducible and predictable, and their adverse effect can be reduced by proper modeling and analysis methods. Here, we propose a statistical model for the probe-level data, and develop model-based estimates for gene expression indexes. We also present model-based methods for identifying and handling cross-hybridizing probes and contaminating array regions. Applications of these results will be presented elsewhere.},

Previous work focused mainly on the development of methods for effective batch effects removal. However, their impact on cross-batch prediction performance, which is one of the most important goals in microarray-based applications, has not been addressed. This paper uses a broad selection of data sets from the Microarray Quality Control Phase II (MAQC-II) effort, generated on three microarray platforms with different causes of batch effects to assess the efficacy of their removal. Two data sets from cross-tissue and cross-platform experiments are also included. Of the 120 cases studied using Support vector machines (SVM) and K nearest neighbors (KNN) as classifiers and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) as performance metric, we find that Ratio-G, Ratio-A, EJLR, mean-centering and standardization methods perform better or equivalent to no batch effect removal in 89, 85, 83, 79 and 75\% of the cases, respectively, suggesting that the application of these methods is generally advisable and ratio-based methods are preferred.},

  abstract = {\subsection{Abstract$<$/h2$>$ 

\subsubsection{Background$<$/h3$>$ The number of gene expression studies in the public domain is rapidly increasing, representing a highly valuable resource. However, dataset-specific bias precludes meta-analysis at the raw transcript level, even when the RNA is from comparable sources and has been processed on the same microarray platform using similar protocols. Here, we demonstrate, using Affymetrix data, that much of this bias can be removed, allowing multiple datasets to be legitimately combined for meaningful meta-analyses. 

\subsubsection{Results$<$/h3$>$ A series of validation datasets comparing breast cancer and normal breast cell lines (MCF7 and MCF10A) were generated to examine the variability between datasets generated using different amounts of starting RNA, alternative protocols, different generations of Affymetrix GeneChip or scanning hardware. We demonstrate that systematic, multiplicative biases are introduced at the RNA, hybridization and image-capture stages of a microarray experiment. Simple batch mean-centering was found to significantly reduce the level of inter-experimental variation, allowing raw transcript levels to be compared across datasets with confidence. By accounting for dataset-specific bias, we were able to assemble the largest gene expression dataset of primary breast tumours to-date (1107), from six previously published studies. Using this meta-dataset, we demonstrate that combining greater numbers of datasets or tumours leads to a greater overlap in differentially expressed genes and more accurate prognostic predictions. However, this is highly dependent upon the composition of the datasets and patient characteristics. 

\subsubsection{Conclusion$<$/h3$>$ Multiplicative, systematic biases are introduced at many stages of microarray experiments. When these are reconciled, raw data can be directly integrated from different gene expression datasets leading to new biological findings with increased statistical power.}

  abstract = {RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%\textendash{}40\% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to $>$85\% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve $>$85\% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at $\lessequivlnt$5\% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Many problems in data integration in bioinformatics can be posed as one common question: Are two sets of observations generated by the same distribution? We propose a kernel-based statistical test for this problem, based on the fact that two distributions are different if and only if there exists at least one function having different expectation on the two distributions. Consequently we use the maximum discrepancy between function means as the basis of a test statistic.The Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) can take advantage of the kernel trick, which allows us to apply it not only to vectors, but strings, sequences, graphs, and other common structured data types arising in molecular biology.Results: We study the practical feasibility of an MMD-based test on three central data integration tasks: Testing cross-platform comparability of microarray data, cancer diagnosis, and data-content based schema matching for two different protein function classification schemas. In all of these experiments, including high-dimensional ones, MMD is very accurate in finding samples that were generated from the same distribution, and outperforms its best competitors.Conclusions: We have defined a novel statistical test of whether two samples are from the same distribution, compatible with both multivariate and structured data, that is fast, easy to implement, and works well, as confirmed by our experiments.Availability:Contact:kb@dbs.ifi.lmu.de},

Here we overcome this limitation by targeting CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to exons encoding functional protein domains. This generates a higher proportion of null mutations and substantially increases the potency of negative selection. We also show that the magnitude of negative selection can be used to infer the functional importance of individual protein domains of interest. A screen of 192 chromatin regulatory domains in murine acute myeloid leukemia cells identifies six known drug targets and 19 additional dependencies. A broader application of this approach may allow comprehensive identification of protein domains that sustain cancer cells and are suitable for drug targeting.},

While the extent of genetic variability in classical pharmacokinetic genes is rather well understood, the role of genetic variation in drug targets is typically less studied. Based on 60,706 human exomes from the ExAC dataset, we performed an in-depth computational analysis of the prevalence of functional-variants in in 806 drug-related genes, including 628 known drug targets. We find that most genetic variants in these genes are very rare (f $<$ 0.1\%) and thus likely not observed in clinical trials. Overall, however, four in five patients are likely to carry a functional-variant in a target for commonly prescribed drugs and many of these might alter drug efficacy. We further computed the likelihood of 1,236 FDA approved drugs to be affected by functional-variants in their targets and show that the patient-risk varies for many drugs with respect to geographic ancestry. A focused analysis of oncological drug targets indicates that the probability of a patient carrying germline variants in oncological drug targets is with 44\% high enough to suggest that not only somatic alterations, but also germline variants carried over into the tumor genome should be included in therapeutic decision-making.},

The finding of these mechanisms and genes invariably requires the application of genomic and functional genomic approaches to tumors or cancer models.

  abstract = {Background
Clinical responses to anti-cancer therapies often only benefit a defined subset of patients. Predicting the best treatment strategy hinges on our ability to effectively translate genomic data into actionable information on drug responses.

Results
To achieve this goal, we compiled a comprehensive collection of baseline cancer genome data and drug response information derived from a large panel of cancer cell lines. This data set was applied to identify the signature genes relevant to drug sensitivity and their resistance by integrating CNVs and the gene expression of cell lines with in vitro drug responses. We presented an efficient in-silico pipeline for integrating heterogeneous cell line data sources with the simultaneous modeling of drug response values across all the drugs and cell lines. Potential signature genes correlated with drug response (sensitive or resistant) in different cancer types were identified. Using signature genes, our collaborative filtering-based drug response prediction model outperformed the 44 algorithms submitted to the DREAM competition on breast cancer cells. The functions of the identified drug response related signature genes were carefully analyzed at the pathway level and the synthetic lethality level. Furthermore, we validated these signature genes by applying them to the classification of the different subtypes of the TCGA tumor samples, and further uncovered their in vivo implications using clinical patient data.

Conclusions
Our work may have promise in translating genomic data into customized marker genes relevant to the response of specific drugs for a specific cancer type of individual patients.},

All of these specific mechanisms are facilitated by the intrinsic hallmarks of cancer, such as tumor cell heterogeneity, redundancy of growth-promoting pathways, increased mutation rate and/or epigenetic alterations, and the dynamic variation of tumor behavior in time and space. Understanding the relative contribution of each of these factors is further complicated by the lack of adequate in vitro models that mimic clinical cancers.

Tumors harbor multiple cell types that are thought to play a role in the development of resistance to drug treatments. Tirosh et al. used single-cell sequencing to investigate the distribution of these differing genetic profiles within melanomas. Many cells harbored heterogeneous genetic programs that reflected two different states of genetic expression, one of which was linked to resistance development. Following drug treatment, the resistance-linked expression state was found at a much higher level. Furthermore, the environment of the melanoma cells affected their gene expression programs.
Science, this issue p. 189
To explore the distinct genotypic and phenotypic states of melanoma tumors, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to 4645 single cells isolated from 19 patients, profiling malignant, immune, stromal, and endothelial cells. Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients. Overall, we begin to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors and how single-cell genomics offers insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies.

We demonstrate both the reproducibility and the clinical translatability of this approach by identifying associations between a genotype and drug response, and established mechanisms of resistance. In addition, our results suggest that PCTs may represent a more accurate approach than cell line models for assessing the clinical potential of some therapeutic modalities. We therefore propose that this experimental paradigm could potentially improve preclinical evaluation of treatment modalities and enhance our ability to predict clinical trial responses.},

Replication tests show that these predictors capture, respectively, \textasciitilde{}40, 20, and 9 percent of total variance for the three traits. For example, predicted heights correlate \textasciitilde{}0.65 with actual height; actual heights of most individuals in validation samples are within a few cm of the prediction. The variance captured for height is comparable to the estimated SNP heritability from GCTA (GREML) analysis, and seems to be close to its asymptotic value (i.e., as sample size goes to infinity), suggesting that we have captured most of the heritability for the SNPs used. Thus, our results resolve the common SNP portion of the "missing heritability" problem - i.e., the gap between prediction R-squared and SNP heritability. The \textasciitilde{}20k activated SNPs in our height predictor reveal the genetic architecture of human height, at least for common SNPs. Our primary dataset is the UK Biobank cohort, comprised of almost 500k individual genotypes with multiple phenotypes. We also use other datasets and SNPs found in earlier GWAS for out-of-sample validation of our results.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypoxia is a major cause of radio- and chemoresistance. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is an endogenous hypoxia-related marker and an important prognostic marker. Assessment of CAIX expression may allow patient selection for hypoxia or CAIX-targeted treatment. The radioactive tracer 111In-girentuximab-F(ab')2 targets CAIX and can be used for SPECT imaging. Aim of this study was to validate and optimize 111In-girentuximab-F(ab')2 for imaging of CAIX expression in head and neck tumor xenografts.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Affinity and internalization kinetics of 111In-girentuximab-F(ab')2 were determined in vitro using CAIX-expressing SK-RC-52 cells. Tumor targeting characteristics were determined in athymic mice with six different head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCNij) xenografts. Tracer uptake was measured by ex vivo radioactivity counting. Intratumoral distribution of tracer uptake was measured using autoradiography and CAIX expression was determined immunohistochemically.
RESULTS: 26\% of the tracer was internalized into the SK-RC-52 cells within 24h. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 0.69$\pm$0.08nM. In biodistribution studies SCCNij153 tumors showed the highest tracer uptake: 4.1$\pm$0.8ID/g at 24h p.i. Immunohistochemical and autoradiographic analyses of the xenografts showed a distinct spatial correlation between localization of the tracer and CAIX expression.
CONCLUSION: 111In-girentuximab-F(ab')2 has a high affinity for CAIX. In vivo tumor uptake correlated strongly with CAIX expression in different head and neck xenografts. These results suggest that 111In-girentuximab-F(ab')2 is a promising tracer for imaging of hypoxia-related CAIX expression.},

CA9 was also positive in five suspected diagnosis of ccRCC. For RT-PCR detection, CA9 was positive in 25/25 biopsy samples of ccRCCs. The diagnostic accuracy of CA9 expression for ccRCC was 100\%. RT-PCR was performed in four biopsies where immunohistochemistry could not be performed because of limited tissue materials or necrosis. Two ccRCCs with a negative staining by immunohistochemistry were CA9 positive by RT-PCR.Conclusions: CA9 may be potentially useful biomarker in help making a diagnosis of ccRCC in the biopsy of renal mass.

  abstract = {Tumor hypoxia is associated clinically with therapeutic resistance and poor patient outcomes. One feature of tumor hypoxia is activated expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), a regulator of pH and tumor growth. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that impeding the reuptake of bicarbonate produced extracellularly by CA9 could exacerbate the intracellular acidity produced by hypoxic conditions, perhaps compromising cell growth and viability as a result. In 8 of 10 cancer cell lines, we found that hypoxia induced the expression of at least one bicarbonate transporter. The most robust and frequent inductions were of the sodium-driven bicarbonate transporters SLC4A4 and SLC4A9, which rely upon both HIF1$\alpha$ and HIF2$\alpha$ activity for their expression. In cancer cell spheroids, SLC4A4 or SLC4A9 disruption by either genetic or pharmaceutical approaches acidified intracellular pH and reduced cell growth. Furthermore, treatment of spheroids with S0859, a small-molecule inhibitor of sodium-driven bicarbonate transporters, increased apoptosis in the cell lines tested. Finally, RNAi-mediated attenuation of SLC4A9 increased apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer spheroids and dramatically reduced growth of MDA-MB-231 breast tumors or U87 gliomas in murine xenografts. Our findings suggest that disrupting pH homeostasis by blocking bicarbonate import might broadly relieve the common resistance of hypoxic tumors to anticancer therapy.

  abstract = {Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is strongly induced by hypoxia and its overexpression is associated with poor therapeutic outcome in cancer. Here, we report that hypoxia promotes tumour heterogeneity through the epigenetic regulation of CAIX. Based on hypoxic CAIX expression we identify and characterize two distinct populations of tumour cells, one that has inducible expression of CAIX and one that does not. The CAIX+ve population is enriched with cells expressing cancer stem cell markers and which have high self-renewal capacity. We show that differential CAIX expression is due to differences in chromatin structure. To further investigate the relationship between chromatin organization and hypoxic induction of CAIX expression we investigated the effect of JQ1 an inhibitor of BET bromodomain proteins and A366 a selective inhibitor of the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a/GLP. We identified that these drugs were able to modulate hypoxic CAIX expression induction. This further highlights the role of epigenetic modification in adaption to hypoxia and also in regulation of heterogeneity of cells within tumours. Interestingly, we identified that the two subpopulations show a differential sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors, NaBu or SAHA, with the CAIX positive showing greater sensitivity to treatment. We propose that drugs modulating chromatin regulation of expression may be used to reduce heterogeneity induced by hypoxia and could in combination have significant clinical consequences.},

Biological changes after Ca9 transfection and after treatment with 5${'}$-azadeoxycytidine were also analysed in cancer cell lines., Results: Non-cancerous tissues strongly expressed Ca9 with membranous localisation. In contrast, Ca9 expression was frequently lost in gastric cancers (p$<$0.001). However, gastric cancers that retained Ca9 expression in cancer cells exhibited a shorter postoperative survival (p$\mkern1mu$=$\mkern1mu$0.028). In vitro analysis revealed that loss of Ca9 expression in gastric cancer cell lines was restored after treatment with 5${'}$-azadeoxycytidine and was associated with increased invasion (p$<$0.01). Moreover, AGS cells transfected with Ca9 exhibited significantly increased cell proliferation (p$<$0.05)., Conclusions: A subgroup of gastric cancers retain Ca9 expression in cancer cells at the invasion front. While loss of Ca9 expression is regulated in part by methylation, re-expression of Ca9 is associated with increased invasion, supporting the hypothesis that increased Ca9 expression may contribute to invasion and thus advanced disease and tumour progression in a subset of gastric cancers.},

The urinary concentrations of VEGF, CA9, angiogenin, and bladder tumor antigen (BTA) were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We used the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves to determine the ability of VEGF, CA9, and angiogenin to detect BCa in voided urine samples. Data were also compared with the findings from a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based BCa detection assay (BTA-Trak). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. The urinary concentrations of VEGF, CA9, angiogenin, and BTA were significantly elevated in those with BCa. VEGF was the most accurate urinary biomarker (area under the curve 0.886, 95\% confidence interval 0.8301-0.9418). Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis highlighted VEGF (odds ratio 5.90, 95\% confidence interval 2.60-13.40, P $<$ .0001) as an independent variable. The sensitivity and specificity for VEGF (83\% sensitivity and 87\% specificity) outperformed those for BTA (80\% sensitivity and 84\% specificity). VEGF could be a valuable addition to voided urine sample analysis for the detection of BCa. Larger, prospective studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of urinary VEGF and angiogenin as biomarkers in the noninvasive evaluation of patients with BCa.},

As carbonic anhydrases (CA) 9 and 12 are induced by the low-oxygen environment within tumors, we investigated the relationship between the expression of these two CA and the presence of metastatic lymph nodes (LN) in uterine cervical cancer. CA9/CA12 expression was evaluated histochemically in primary cervical cancer tissues of 73 patients who underwent laparoscopic LN staging and two patients with clinical staging before definitive radiotherapy at the National Cancer Center, Korea. We also evaluated CA9 expression in 33 patients with pathologically confirmed metastatic LN. CA9 expression in the primary tumors was significantly associated with LN metastasis (P~=~0.03) and poorer disease-free survival (relative risk, 6.1; 95\% confidence interval, 1.3\textendash{}28.3, P~=~0.02, multivariate analysis), whereas CA12 expression did not show such a relationship. In addition, 21 of 24 metastatic LN revealed similar CA9 expression (P~=~0.001), suggesting that CA9-expressing tumor cells had a higher metastatic potential. CA9 was expressed in 45 of 75 (60\%) primary tumors, with positive tumor cells observed predominantly in the area away from the blood vessels. In contrast, CA12 expression was observed in only 29 of 74 primary tumors (39\%), without a specific pattern. These findings indicate that expression of CA9, but not CA12, in tumors is associated with the presence of LN metastases and poorer prognosis. Selective application of new treatment modalities based on CA9 expression to prevent LN metastases may improve overall treatment outcome in patients with uterine cervical cancer.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypoxia modifies the phenotype of tumors in a way that promotes tumor aggressiveness and resistance towards chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the expression and influence of hypoxia-regulated proteins on tumor biology are not well characterized in colorectal tumors. We studied the role of protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) in patients with colorectal adenocarcinomas.
METHODS: Expression of HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, CA9 and GLUT1 was quantified by immunohistochemistry in 133 colorectal adenocarcinomas. The expression of hypoxia markers was correlated with clinicopathological variables and overall patient survival.
RESULTS: Expression of these hypoxia markers was detected in the epithelial compartment of the tumor cells as well as in tumor-associated stromal cells. Although tumor cells frequently showed expression of one or more of the investigated hypoxia markers, no correlation among these markers or with clinical response was found. However, within the tumor stroma, positive correlations between the hypoxia markers HIF-2alpha, CA9 and GLUT1 were observed. Furthermore expression of HIF-2alpha and CA9 in tumor-associated stroma were both associated with a significantly reduced overall survival. In the Cox proportional hazard model, stromal HIF-2alpha expression was an independent prognostic factor for survival.
CONCLUSION: These observations show, that expression of hypoxia regulated proteins in tumor-associated stromal cells, as opposed to their expression in epithelial tumor cells, is associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer. This study suggests that tumor hypoxia may influence tumor-associated stromal cells in a way that ultimately contributes to patient prognosis.},

  abstract = {Esophageal cancer consists of two major histologic types: esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), predominant globally, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which has a higher incidence in westernized countries. Five-year overall survival is 15\%. Clinical trials frequently combine histologic types although they are different diseases with distinct origins. In the evolving era of personalized medicine and targeted therapies, we hypothesized that ESCC and EAC have genomic differences important for developing new therapeutic strategies for esophageal cancer. We explored DNA copy number abnormalities in 70 ESCCs with publicly available array data and 189 EACs from our group. All data was from single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Analysis was performed using a segmentation algorithm. Log ratio thresholds for copy number gain and loss were set at $\pm$0.2 (approximately 2.3 and 1.7 copies, respectively). The ESCC and EAC genomes showed some copy number abnormalities with similar frequencies (eg, CDKN2A, EGFR, KRAS, MYC, CDK6, MET) but also many copy number abnormalities with different frequencies between histologic types, most of which were amplification events. Some of these regions harbor genes for which targeted therapies are currently available (VEGFA, ERBB2) or for which agents are in clinical trials (PIK3CA, FGFR1). Other regions contain putative oncogenes that may be targeted in the future. Using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays we compared genomic abnormalities in a large cohort of EACs and ESCCs. We report here the similar and different frequencies of copy number abnormalities in ESCC and EAC. These results may allow development of histology-specific therapeutic agents for esophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {Approximately 30\% of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) present as metastatic disease. Molecular markers have the potential to characterize accurately the biological behavior of tumors and they may be useful for determining prognosis. A custom tissue array was constructed using clear cell RCC from 150 patients with metastatic RCC who underwent nephrectomy prior to immunotherapy. The tissue array was stained for 8 molecular markers, namely Ki67, p53, gelsolin, carbonic anhydrase (CA)9, CA12, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10), epithelial cell adhesion molecule and vimentin. Marker status and established clinical predictors of prognosis were considered when developing a prognostic model for disease specific survival. On univariate Cox regression analysis certain markers were statistically significant predictors of survival, namely CA9 (p $<$0.00001), p53 (p = 0.0072), gelsolin (p = 0.030), Ki67 (p = 0.036) and CA12 (p = 0.043). On multivariate Cox regression analysis that included all markers and clinical variables CA9 (p = 0.00002), PTEN (p $<$0.0001), vimentin (p = 0.0032), p53 (p = 0.028), T category (p = 0.0025) and performance status (p = 0.0013) were significant independent predictors of disease specific survival and they were used to construct a combined molecular and clinical prognostic model. The bias corrected concordance index (C-index) of this combined prognostic model was C = 0.68, which was significantly higher (p = 0.0033) than that of a multivariate clinical predictor model (C = 0.62) based on the UCLA Integrated Staging System (T category, histological grade and performance status). In patients with clear cell RCC a prognostic model for survival that includes molecular and clinical predictors is significantly more accurate than a standard clinical model using the combination of stage, histological grade and performance status.},

This study examines the role of parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and perfusion computed tomography (CT) as surrogate markers of intratumoral hypoxia, defined by using the exogenous marker of hypoxia pimonidazole and the endogenous marker carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9). Patients with HNC underwent preoperative DCE-MRI, perfusion CT, and pimonidazole infusion. Imaging parameters were correlated with pimonidazole and CA9 staining. The strength of correlations was tested by using a two-tailed Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Twenty-three regions of interest were analyzed from the 7 patients who completed the DCE-MRI studies. A number of statistically significant correlations were seen between DCE-MRI parameters (volume transfer between blood plasma and extracellular extravascular space [EES], volume of EES, rate constant between EES and blood plasma, time at arrival of contrast inflow, time to peak, average gradient, and time to onset) and areas with a pimonidazole score of 4. In the case of CA9 staining, only a weak correlation was shown with wash-in rate. There were no significant correlations between perfusion CT parameters and pimonidazole staining or CA9 expression. Intratumoral hypoxia in patients with HNC may be predicted by using DCE-MRI; however, perfusion CT requires further investigation.},

The addition of Trastuzumab to standard of care chemotherapy in clinical trials has been shown to improve outcomes for early stage as well as metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer. The most clinically significant side effect of Trastuzumab is the risk of cardiac myocyte injury, leading to the development of congestive heart failure.

  abstract = {Pediatric sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors of bone and soft tissue origin. Although more than 100 different histologic subtypes have been described, the majority of pediatric cases belong to the Ewing's family of tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma. Most patients that present with localized stage are curable with surgery and/or chemotherapy; however, those with metastatic disease at diagnosis or those who experience a relapse continue to have a very poor prognosis. New therapies for these patients are urgently needed. Immunotherapy is an established treatment modality for both liquid and solid tumors, and in pediatrics, most notably for neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. In the past, immunomodulatory agents such as interferon, interleukin-2, and liposomal-muramyl tripeptide phosphatidyl-ethanolamine have been tried, with some activity seen in subsets of patients; additionally, various cancer vaccines have been studied with possible benefit. Monoclonal antibody therapies against tumor antigens such as disialoganglioside GD2 or immune checkpoint targets such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 are being actively explored in pediatric sarcomas. Building on the success of adoptive T cell therapy for EBV-related lymphoma, strategies to redirect T cells using chimeric antigen receptors and bispecific antibodies are rapidly evolving with potential for the treatment of sarcomas. This review will focus on recent preclinical and clinical developments in targeted agents for pediatric sarcomas with emphasis on the immunobiology of immune checkpoints, immunoediting, tumor microenvironment, antibody engineering, cell engineering, and tumor vaccines. The future integration of antibody-based and cell-based therapies into an overall treatment strategy of sarcoma will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been recently suggested to contribute to tumorigenesis by an autocrine mechanism in fibroblast cells overexpressing its receptor, the MET/HGFR protein. Since epithelial cells represent the primary physiologic target of HGF, we investigated whether inappropriate expression of HGF by epithelial cells which normally express MET/HGFR may also contribute to tumorigenesis. We have transfected a full length rat HGF gene into three mouse epithelial cell lines, one derived from breast (MM55) and two (BNL CL.2 and NMuLi) representing liver non-parenchymal epithelial cells (NPEC). We confirmed the presence of the transfected gene by Southern blot analysis, the production of HGF protein by immunofluorescence, and the preservation of HGF biologic activity by bio-assay. In comparison to untransfected cells, all three HGF-transfected cell lines displayed high level MET/HGFR autophosphorylation and increased ability to proliferate in media containing low serum. The two HGF-transfected liver NPEC lines, but not the HGF-transfected mammary cell line, displayed loss of cell contact growth-inhibition and acquired a markedly increased ability to form colonies in soft agar. Furthermore, the NPEC HGF-transfected cell lines formed much larger tumors in nude mice than the untransfected counterparts, with extensive invasion and sporadic lung metastases. These results demonstrate that overexpression of HGF in at least some epithelial cells contribute to tumorigenesis, and furthermore suggest a possible role for the HGF-MET/HGFR system in the progression of certain epithelial tumors.},

  abstract = {Purpose Cabozantinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and rearranged during transfection (RET), demonstrated clinical activity in patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in phase I.   Patients and Methods We conducted a double-blind, phase III trial comparing cabozantinib with placebo in 330 patients with documented radiographic progression of metastatic MTC. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to cabozantinib (140 mg per day) or placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Additional outcome measures included tumor response rate, overall survival, and safety.   Results The estimated median PFS was 11.2 months for cabozantinib versus 4.0 months for placebo (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95\% CI, 0.19 to 0.40; P $<$ .001). Prolonged PFS with cabozantinib was observed across all subgroups including by age, prior TKI treatment, and RET mutation status (hereditary or sporadic). Response rate was 28\% for cabozantinib and 0\% for placebo; responses were seen regardless of RET mutation status. Kaplan-Meier estimates of patients alive and progression-free at 1 year are 47.3\% for cabozantinib and 7.2\% for placebo. Common cabozantinib-associated adverse events included diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, decreased weight and appetite, nausea, and fatigue and resulted in dose reductions in 79\% and holds in 65\% of patients. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 16\% of cabozantinib-treated patients and in 8\% of placebo-treated patients.   Conclusion Cabozantinib (140 mg per day) achieved a statistically significant improvement of PFS in patients with progressive metastatic MTC and represents an important new treatment option for patients with this rare disease. This dose of cabozantinib was associated with significant but manageable toxicity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:

The authors systematically reviewed the literature and conducted a pooled analysis of studies on small renal masses who underwent active surveillance to identify the risk progression and the characteristics associated with metastases.

METHODS:

A search of the MEDLINE database was performed to identify all clinical series that reported the surveillance of localized renal masses. For studies that reported individual-level data, clinical and radiographic characteristics of tumors without progression were compared with the characteristics of tumors that progressed to metastases.

RESULTS:

Eighteen series (880 patients, 936 masses) met screening criteria; and, among these, 18 patients were identified who had tumors that progressed to metastasis (mean, 40.2 months). Six studies (259 patients, 284 masses) provided individual-level data for pooled analysis. At a mean ($\pm$standard deviation) follow-up of 33.5 $\pm$ 22.6 months, the mean initial greatest tumor dimension was 2.3 $\pm$ 1.3 cm, and mean linear growth rate was 0.31 $\pm$ 0.38 cm per year. Sixty-five masses (23\%) exhibited zero net growth under surveillance, and none of those masses progressed to metastasis. A pooled analysis revealed increased age (age 75.1 $\pm$ 9.1 years vs 66.6 $\pm$ 12.3 years; P = .03), an initial greatest tumor dimension (4.1 $\pm$ 2.1 cm vs 2.3 $\pm$ 1.3 cm; P $<$ .0001), initial estimated tumor volume (66.3 $\pm$ 100.0 cm3 vs 15.1 $\pm$ 60.3 cm3; p = .0001), linear growth rate of (0.8 $\pm$ 0.65 cm per year vs 0.3 $\pm$ 0.4 cm per year; P = .0001), and a volumetric growth rate of 27.1 $\pm$ 24.9 cm3 per year (vs 6.2 $\pm$ 27.5 cm3 per year; P $<$ .0001) in the progression cohort.

CONCLUSIONS:

A substantial proportion of small renal masses remained radiographically static after an initial period of active surveillance. Progression to metastases occurred in a small percentage of patients and generally was a late event. The current results indicated that, in patients who have competing health risks, radiographic surveillance may be an acceptable initial approach, and delayed intervention may be reserved for patients who have tumors that exhibit significant linear or volumetric growth.

  abstract = {Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a biologically heterogeneous disease, with many small renal masses (SRMs) exhibiting an indolent natural history, while others progress more rapidly to become life-threatening. Existing multiphase contrast-enhanced imaging methods, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, cannot definitively distinguish between benign and malignant solid tumors or identify histologic subtype, and early results of molecular imaging studies (positron emission tomography [PET]) in the evaluation of SRMs have not improved on these established modalities. Alternative molecular markers/agents recognizing aberrant cellular pathways of cellular oxidative metabolism, DNA synthesis, and tumor hypoxia tracers are currently under development and investigation for RCC assessment, but to date none are yet clinically applicable or available. In contrast, immuno-PET offers highly selective binding to cancer-specific antigens, and might identify radiographically recognizable and distinct molecular targets. A phase I proof-of-concept study first demonstrated the ability of immuno-PET to discriminate between clear-cell RCC (ccRCC) and non-ccRCC, utilizing a chimeric monoclonal antibody to carbonic anhydrase IX (cG250, girentuximab) labeled with 124I (124I-girentuximab PET); the study examined patients with renal masses who subsequently underwent standard surgical resection. A follow-up phase III multicenter trial confirmed that 124I-cG250-PET can accurately and noninvasively identify ccRCC with high sensitivity (86\%), specificity (87\%), and positive predictive value (95\%). In the challenge to appropriately match treatment of an incidentally identified SRM to its biological potential, this highly accurate and histologically specific molecular imaging modality demonstrates the ability of imaging to provide clinically important preoperative diagnostic information, which can result in optimal and personalized therapy.},

  abstract = {Background
Patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have a dismal prognosis. Therefore, new and less toxic treatments are needed.
Objective
We determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and potential therapeutic efficacy of multiple infusions of lutetium 177 (177Lu)-girentuximab (cG250) on various dose levels in a phase 1 trial in patients with progressive metastasized ccRCC.
Design, setting, and participants
In this uncontrolled case series in 23 patients with progressive ccRCC metastases, cG250 accumulation was verified by diagnostic indium 111-cG250 imaging. Patients then received a high-activity dose of 177Lu-cG250.
Intervention
Groups of three patients received 177Lu-cG250, starting at a dose level of 1110 MBq/m2 177Lu-cG250, with dose increments of 370 MBq/m2 per group. In the absence of persistent toxicity, progressive disease, and accelerated blood clearance, patients were eligible for retreatment after 3 mo with 75\% of the previous activity dose. Patients could receive a total of three treatment cycles.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis
Determination of the MTD was the primary and therapeutic efficacy was the secondary outcome measurement of the study.
Results and limitations
The MTD was 2405 MBq/m2 because higher doses resulted in dose-limiting myelotoxicity. Some patients received second (13 of 23 [56\%]) and third (4 of 23 [17\%]) treatment cycles. Most patients (17 of 23 [74\%]) demonstrated stable disease 3 mo after the first treatment, and one patient showed a partial response that lasted for 9 mo. Mean growth of target tumor lesions was reduced from 40.4\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], $\pm$17.0) during the last 3 mo before study entry to 5.5\% (95\% CI, $\pm$5.3; p$<$0.001) at 3 mo after the first treatment cycle. No major nonhematologic side effects were observed.
Conclusions
177Lu-cG250 radioimmunotherapy in metastatic ccRCC patients is well tolerated at an activity dose level as high as 2405 MBq/m2 (MTD). Radioimmunotherapy with 177Lu-cG250 may stabilize previously progressive metastatic ccRCC.},

Improved and more frequent radiologic evaluation has resulted in increased identification of renal masses of unknown origin, which frequently pose a diagnostic dilemma for urologists.
Objective
Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is an antigen ubiquitously expressed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The specific and high level of expression in ccRCC makes CAIX an excellent target for imaging ccRCC lesions. We present our experience with immuno\textendash{}single-photon emission computed tomography (immunoSPECT) imaging with the indium-111 (111In)\textendash{}labeled anti-CAIX antibody girentuximab in patients presenting with either a primary renal tumor or a history of ccRCC and lesions suspect for metastases during follow-up.
Design, setting, and participants
Twenty-nine patients received 100\textendash{}200 MBq 111In-labeled girentuximab. Whole-body and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were acquired after 4\textendash{}7 d.
Intervention
Injection with 111In-girentuximab and image acquisition after 4\textendash{}7 d.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis
Accuracy of 111In-girentuximab immunoSPECT.
Results and limitations
Distinct uptake of 111In-girentuximab was seen in 16 of 22 patients presenting with a renal mass. All renal masses proven to be ccRCC after resection (n=15) were detected with 111In-girentuximab. Suspect lesions of six patients showed no uptake of 111In-girentuximab. In these patients, ccRCC was not found, nor progression occurred. Seven patients with a history of ccRCC and possible metastatic lesions on follow-up computed tomography scans were imaged with 111In-girentuximab. In four of these patients, the lesions showed preferential uptake of 111In-girentuximab and local or systemic treatment was initiated. In three other cases, no 111In-girentuximab targeting was seen. During follow-up of these three patients, one showed progression, for which systemic treatment was started. In the two other patients, no progression occurred, suggesting a benign nature.
Conclusions
111In-girentuximab immunoSPECT can be used to detect ccRCC lesions in patients with a primary renal mass and to clarify the nature of lesions suspect for metastases in patients with a history of ccRCC.},

Girentuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds carbonic anhydrase IX, a cell surface glycoprotein ubiquitously expressed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Its safety and activity in phase 2 studies prompted investigation into its use as adjuvant monotherapy in participants with high-risk ccRCC.$<$/p$>$

\subsubsection{Objective$<$/h3$>$

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjuvant girentuximab on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with localized completely resected high-risk ccRCC.$<$/p$>$

\subsubsection{Design, Setting, and Participants$<$/h3$>$

The ARISER trial (Adjuvant Rencarex Immunotherapy Phase 3 Trial to Study Efficacy in Nonmetastatic RCC) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial that took place between June 10, 2004, and April 2, 2013, at 142 academic medical centers in 15 countries in North and South America and Europe. Eligible adult patients had undergone partial or radical nephrectomy for histologically confirmed ccRCC and fell into 1 of the following high-risk groups: pT3/pT4Nx/N0M0 or pTanyN+M0 or pT1b/pT2Nx/N0M0 with nuclear grade 3 or greater. Patients were assigned via central computerized double-blind 1:1 randomization to receive either a single loading dose of girentuximab, 50 mg (week 1), followed by weekly intravenous infusions of girentuximab, 20 mg (weeks 2-24), or placebo, stratified by risk group and region. The data were analyzed from March 31, 2012, to April 2, 2013.$<$/p$>$

\subsubsection{Main Outcomes and Measures$<$/h3$>$

Co\textendash{}primary end points were DFS and OS, based on imaging studies assessed by independent radiological review committee. Secondary end points included safety, assessed as the rate and grade of adverse events.$<$/p$>$

\subsubsection{Results$<$/h3$>$

A total of 864 patients (66\% male; median [interquartile range] age, 58 [51-65] years) were randomized to girentuximab (n = 433) or placebo (n = 431). Compared with placebo, participants treated with girentuximab had no statistically significant DFS (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.79-1.18) or OS advantage (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95\% CI, 0.74-1.32). Median DFS was 71.4 months (interquartile range, 3 months to not reached) for girentuximab and never reached for placebo group. Median OS was never reached regardless of treatment. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 185 patients (21.6\%), reported comparably between arms. Serious adverse events occurred in 72 patients (8.4\%), reported comparably between arms. One drug-related serious adverse event occurred in a patient receiving placebo.$<$/p$>$

\subsubsection{Conclusions and Relevance$<$/h3$>$

Girentuximab had no clinical benefit as adjuvant treatment for patients with high-risk ccRCC. The surprisingly long DFS and OS in these patients represent a challenge to adjuvant ccRCC drug development.$<$/p$>$

  abstract = {Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Although TKIs have demonstrated good clinical efficacy, the lack of complete responses, the chronic nature of the treatment, and the side effects are clear disadvantages. An interesting new approach in the treatment of clear cell RCC is antibody-mediated therapy with the chimeric anti\textendash{}carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) antibody girentuximab (cG250). As the results of several girentuximab trials become available, the question arises of whether TKI treatment can be combined with girentuximab-based therapy. In this study, we assessed the effect of the widely used TKI sorafenib on the tumor-targeting potential of 111In-labeled girentuximab. Methods: 111In-girentuximab imaging was performed on 15 patients suspected of having a renal malignancy, with surgery being part of their treatment plan. Of these, 10 patients were treated in a neoadjuvant setting with sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily). Five patients received treatment during 1 wk, and 5 patients received treatment during 4 wk. In both sorafenib-treated groups, baseline and posttreatment tumor targeting of 111In-girentuximab were compared. Surgery was performed 3 d after the last image acquisition. Five additional patients were included as a control group and had only a single 111In-girentuximab injection and scintigraphy without any treatment. Distribution of 111In-girentuximab was determined scintigraphically ex vivo in a 1-cm lamella of the resected tumorous kidney. Expression of CAIX and of the vascular marker CD31 was determined immunohistochemically on specimens of both tumor and normal kidney tissue. Results: Treatment with sorafenib resulted in a marked decrease of 111In-girentuximab uptake in the tumor in clear cell RCC patients, especially in the group treated for 4 wk (mean change in both sorafenib-treated groups, -38.4\%; range, +9.1\% to -79.4\%). Immunohistochemical analysis showed markedly reduced CD31 expression and vessel density in the sorafenib-treated groups but no differences in CAIX expression between the sorafenib-treated groups and the nontreated patients. Conclusion: Treatment with sorafenib resulted in a treatment duration\textendash{}dependent significantly decreased uptake of 111In-girentumab in clear cell RCC lesions. These results indicate that the efficacy of antibody-mediated treatment or diagnosis modalities is hampered by TKI treatment.},

  abstract = {Near-infrared dye-tagged antibodies can be used for the sensitive detection of tumor tissue in vivo. Surgery for clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) might benefit from the use of optical imaging to facilitate the intraoperative detection of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)\textendash{}expressing tumor lesions with chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) girentuximab, which has been shown to have excellent imaging capabilities for ccRCC. Here we studied the potential of fluorescence imaging to detect ccRCC tumors in nude mice with RCC xenografts by using mAb girentuximab conjugated with IRDye800CW; SPECT imaging was used as a reference. Methods: Groups of athymic BALB/c mice with subcutaneous CAIX-positive SK-RC-52 ccRCC tumors were injected intravenously with 125I-labeled girentuximab-IRDye800CW or 125I-labeled girentuximab. For determination of the specificity of the accumulation of the anti-CAIX antibody conjugate in ccRCC, separate groups of mice bearing a CAIX-positive tumor (SK-RC-52) and a CAIX-negative tumor (SK-RC-59) received 125I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW or 125I-labeled MOPC21-IRDye800CW (control mAb). Optical images and micro-SPECT images were acquired until 3 d after injection. Mice were euthanized after the last imaging session, and the biodistribution of the radiolabeled antibody preparations was determined. Results: Optical imaging and micro-SPECT imaging at 1 d after the injection of 125I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW showed clear delineation of the CAIX-expressing ccRCC xenografts, and image contrast improved with time. Fluorescence imaging and biodistribution studies showed high and specific uptake of 125I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW in CAIX-positive ccRCC xenografts (SK-RC-52, 31.5 $\pm$ 9.6 percentage injected dose per gram [\%ID/g] at 72 h after injection). Tumor uptake was specific, as very low uptake of 125I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW was noted in the CAIX-negative SK-RC-59 tumor (4.1 $\pm$ 1.5 \%ID/g), and no uptake of 125I-MOPC21-IRDye800CW (control mAb) was noted in the CAIX-positive SK-RC-52 tumor (1.2 $\pm$ 0.1 \%ID/g). Conclusion: Subcutaneous CAIX-expressing ccRCC xenografts were visualized by optical imaging with 125I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW. Optical images showed good concordance with micro-SPECT images. The accumulation of 125I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW in ccRCC tumors was high and specific. Girentuximab-IRDye800CW potentially could be used for the intraoperative detection of CAIX-expressing tumors and the assessment of residual tumor in resection margins or metastatic lesions in patients with ccRCC.},

  abstract = {Despite advances in the treatment of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), there is still an unmet need in the treatment of this disease. A phase 2 radioimmunotherapy (RIT) trial with lutetium 177 (177Lu)\textendash{}girentuximab was initiated to evaluate the efficacy of this approach. In this nonrandomized single-arm trial, patients with progressive metastatic ccRCC who met the inclusion criteria received 2405 MBq/m2 of 177Lu-girentuximab intravenously. In the absence of persistent toxicity and progressive disease, patients were eligible for retreatment after 3 mo with 75\% of the previous activity dose. A total of 14 patients were included. After the first therapeutic infusion, eight patients (57\%) had stable disease (SD) and one (7\%) had a partial regression. The treatment was generally well tolerated but resulted in grade 3\textendash{}4 myelotoxicity in most patients. After the second cycle, continued SD was observed in five of six patients, but none were eligible for retreatment due to prolonged thrombocytopenia. In conclusion, RIT with 177Lu-girentuximab resulted in disease stabilization in 9 of 14 patients with progressive metastatic ccRCC, but myelotoxicity prevented retreatment in some patients.
Patient summary
We investigated the efficacy of lutetium 177\textendash{}girentuximab radioimmunotherapy in patients with metastatic kidney cancer. The treatment resulted in disease stabilization in 9 of 14 patients. The main toxicity was prolonged low blood cell counts.

  abstract = {Background and purpose
Hypoxia is a major cause of radio- and chemoresistance. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is an endogenous hypoxia-related marker and an important prognostic marker. Assessment of CAIX expression may allow patient selection for hypoxia or CAIX-targeted treatment. The radioactive tracer 111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 targets CAIX and can be used for SPECT imaging. Aim of this study was to validate and optimize 111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 for imaging of CAIX expression in head and neck tumor xenografts.
Material and methods
Affinity and internalization kinetics of 111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 were determined in vitro using CAIX-expressing SK-RC-52 cells. Tumor targeting characteristics were determined in athymic mice with six different head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCNij) xenografts. Tracer uptake was measured by ex vivo radioactivity counting. Intratumoral distribution of tracer uptake was measured using autoradiography and CAIX expression was determined immunohistochemically.
Results
26\% of the tracer was internalized into the SK-RC-52 cells within 24\hspace{0.25em}h. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 0.69\hspace{0.25em}$\pm$\hspace{0.25em}0.08\hspace{0.25em}nM. In biodistribution studies SCCNij153 tumors showed the highest tracer uptake: 4.1\hspace{0.25em}$\pm$\hspace{0.25em}0.8\hspace{0.25em}ID/g at 24\hspace{0.25em}h p.i. Immunohistochemical and autoradiographic analyses of the xenografts showed a distinct spatial correlation between localization of the tracer and CAIX expression.
Conclusion
111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 has a high affinity for CAIX. In vivo tumor uptake correlated strongly with CAIX expression in different head and neck xenografts. These results suggest that 111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 is a promising tracer for imaging of hypoxia-related CAIX expression.},

  abstract = {The transcriptional complex hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) has emerged as an important mediator of gene expression patterns in tumors, although the range of responding genes is still incompletely defined. Here we show that the tumor-associated carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are tightly regulated by this system. Both CA9 and CA12 were strongly induced by hypoxia in a range of tumor cell lines. In renal carcinoma cells that are defective for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor, up-regulation of these CAs is associated with loss of regulation by hypoxia, consistent with the critical function of pVHL in the regulation of HIF-1. Further studies of CA9 defined a HIF-1-dependent hypoxia response element in the minimal promoter and demonstrated that tight regulation by the HIF/pVHL system was reflected in the pattern of CA IX expression within tumors. Generalized up-regulation of CA IX in VHL-associated renal cell carcinoma contrasted with focal perinecrotic expression in a variety of non-VHL-associated tumors. In comparison with vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA, expression of CA IX demonstrated a similar, although more tightly circumscribed, pattern of expression around regions of necrosis and showed substantial although incomplete overlap with activation of the hypoxia marker pimonidazole. These studies define a new class of HIF-1-responsive gene, the activation of which has implications for the understanding of hypoxic tumor metabolism and which may provide endogenous markers for tumor hypoxia.},

  abstract = {Non\textendash{}small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a difficult disease to treat. The c-Met receptor is an attractive potential target for novel therapeutic inhibition in human cancers. We provide strong evidence that c-Met is overexpressed, activated, and sometimes mutated in NSCLC cell lines and tumor tissues. Expression of c-Met was found in all (100\%) of the NSCLC tumor tissues examined (n = 23) and most (89\%) of the cell lines (n = 9). Sixty-one percent of tumor tissues strongly expressed total c-Met, especially adenocarcinoma (67\%). Specific expression of phospho-Met (p-Met) [Y1003] and [Y1230/1234/1235] was seen by immunohistochemistry. p-Met expression was preferentially observed at the NSCLC tumor invasive fronts. c-Met alterations were identified within the semaphorin domain (E168D, L299F, S323G, and N375S) and the juxtamembrane domain (R988C, R988C + T1010I, S1058P, and alternative splice product skipping entire juxtamembrane domain) of a NSCLC cell line and adenocarcinoma tissues. We validated c-Met as potential therapeutic target using small interfering RNA down-regulation of the receptor expression by 50\% to 60\% in NSCLC cells. This led to inhibition of p-Met and phospho-AKT and up to 57.1 $\pm$ 7.2\% cell viability inhibition at 72 hours. The selective small molecule inhibitor of c-Met SU11274 inhibited cell viability in c-Met-expressing NSCLC cells. SU11274 also abrogated hepatocyte growth factor\textendash{}induced phosphorylation of c-Met and its downstream signaling. Here, we provide first direct evidence by small interfering RNA targeting and small molecule inhibitor that c-Met is important in NSCLC biology and biochemistry. These results indicate that c-Met inhibition will be an important therapeutic strategy against NSCLC to improve its clinical outcome.},

  abstract = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer, and most patients present with cancer already spread beyond the lung. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-MET has been implicated in various solid tumors, including SCLC, and is involved in mediating tumorigenesis, cell motility, scattering, invasion and metastasis. Mutations of c-Met have been described in renal papillary carcinoma and gastrointestinal cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma. The sequence of c-MET was examined for possible mutations in the 10 SCLC cell lines and 32 paired-SCLC/normal tissues. Novel c-MET alterations were identified among 3 of 10 separate SCLC cell lines and in 4 of 32 SCLC tumor tissue samples. These include two different c-MET missense mutations in the juxtamembrane (JM) domain (R988C found in NCI-H69 and H249 cell lines; and T1010I in SCLC tumor sample T31). Also, there are one Sema domain missense mutation (E168D in SCLC tumor sample T5), two-base-pair insertional mutations (IVS13- (52\textendash{}53)insCT in both SCLC tumor samples T26 and T27) within the pre-JM intron 13, as well as an alternative transcript involving exon 10 (H128 cell line). c-MET receptors are expressed at various levels among the 10 SCLC cell lines studied (high expression: H69, H345, H510, and H526; medium-expression: H128 and H146; and low/no-expression: H82, H209, H249, and H446). The level of c-MET expression does not have any apparent correlation with presence or absence of mutations of c-MET in the cell lines. We show that the two identified JM mutations (R988C and T1010I), when introduced into the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent BaF3 cell line, regulated cell proliferation resulting in a small but significant growth factor independence. When introduced into a SCLC cell line (H446, with minimal endogenous wild-type c-MET expression), the JM mutations also regulated cell morphology and adhesion, as well as causing enhanced tumorigenicity by both increases in focus-formation and soft-agar colony-formation assays. Both of the JM mutations also increased cell motility and migration evident in wound healing assay and time-lapse video-microscopy speed analysis. The JM mutations also altered the c-MET RTK signaling, resulting in preferentially increased constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins, including the key focal adhesion protein paxillin on tyrosine residue Y31 (first CRKL-binding site), correlating with increased motility. These results suggest a novel and unique role of the JM domain in c-MET signaling in SCLC with significant implications in cytoskeletal functions and metastatic potential. The novel JM gain-of-function somatic mutations described are the first to be reported in SCLC, and may be associated with a more aggressive phenotype. It would now be useful to study the inhibition of c-MET as a therapeutic target against SCLC.},

These pleiotropic actions are fundamentally important during development, homeostasis, and tissue regeneration. HGF signaling also contributes to oncogenesis and tumor progression in several human cancers and promotes aggressive cellular invasiveness that is strongly linked to tumor metastasis. Our present understanding of c-Met oncogenic signaling supports at least three avenues of pathway selective anticancer drug development: antagonism of ligand/receptor interaction, inhibition of TK catalytic activity, and blockade of intracellular receptor/effector interactions. Potent and selective preclinical drug candidates have been developed using all three strategies, and human clinical trials in two of the three areas are now under way.},

  abstract = {8001  Background:  c-Met-amplified NSCLC defines a subset of NSCLC that may be sensitive to the small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib, approved multinationally for the treatment of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. Efficacy and safety data are presented for crizotinib in patients with advanced c-Met-amplified NSCLC within 3 categories of amplification MET/CEP7 ratio $\geq$1.8-$\leq$2.2 (Low), $>$2.2-$<$5 (Intermediate) and $\geq$5 (High).  Methods:  c-METamplification status was determined by FISH, with 10-12 patients to be enrolled into each amplification category.  If 2 or more objective responses occur in a category, 19 additional patients are to be enrolled.  This study is part of an ongoing phase 1 crizotinib study (NCT00585195).  Patients received crizotinib 250 mg BID. Responses were assessed using RECIST v1.0.  Results:  At data cut-off, 16 patients were enrolled; 3 were subsequently determined not to have an amplification meeting MET/CEP7 criteria.  13 patients with c-MET-amplifiedNSCLC [Low (n=1), Intermediate (n=6) and High (n=6)] enrolled and received crizotinib, with 12 evaluable for response. Median age was 63 years (range 42-79), 92\% of patients were ECOG 0 or 1 and  77\% were ex-smokers. To date 4 PRs (33\%; 95\% CI: 10,65) have been observed (Low (n=0), Intermediate (n=1; 20\%) and High (3; 50\%).  Median duration of response was 35 weeks [95\% CI: 16,112]. Median treatment duration was 15.7 weeks (range 4 -188), and 6 patients were on treatment at the data cut-off; 5 patients have died (all disease-related). 75\% of the 16 patients enrolled had treatment-related adverse events (AEs): most commonly diarrhea (50\%), nausea (31\%), vomiting (31\%), peripheral edema (n=25\%) and visual impairment (25\%). Most AEs were grade 1 in severity. There were no treatment-related serious AEs or treatment-related permanent discontinuations. Accrual of patients with c-Met-amplified NSCLC is ongoing.  Conclusions:  Crizotinib appears to have antitumor activity in patients with c-Met-amplified NSCLC and a generally tolerable and manageable AE profile. These findings warrant further study of crizotinib in advanced c-MET-amplified NSCLC and ongoing exploration of the MET/CEP7 ratio associated with clinical benefit.

Notably, activating mutations in c-Met have been positively identified in patients with a particular hereditary form of papillary renal cancer, directly implicating c-Met in human tumorigenesis. Aberrant signaling of the c-Met signaling pathway due to dysregulation of the c-Met receptor or overexpression of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), has been associated with an aggressive phenotype. Extensive evidence that c-Met signaling is involved in the progression and spread of several cancers and an enhanced understanding of its role in disease have generated considerable interest in c-Met and HGF as major targets in cancer drug development. This has led to the development of a variety of c-Met pathway antagonists with potential clinical applications. The three main approaches of pathway-selective anticancer drug development have included antagonism of ligand/receptor interaction, inhibition of the tyrosine kinase catalytic activity, and blockade of the receptor/effector interaction. Several c-Met antagonists are now under clinical investigation. Preliminary clinical results of several of these agents, including both monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have been encouraging. Several multitargeted therapies have also been under investigation in the clinic and have demonstrated promise, particularly with regard to tyrosine kinase inhibition.},

The role of c-Met/HGF axis in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has not been reported previously. We have determined the expression of p170c-Met precursor and p140c-Met $\beta$-chain in seven SCLC cell lines by immunoblotting. We used the SCLC cell line H69, which expressed an abundant amount of c-Met to study the function and downstream effects of c-Met activation. Stimulation of H69 cells with HGF (40 ng/ml, 6-h stimulation) significantly altered cell motility of the SCLC cells with increased formation of filopodia and membrane ruffling, characterized as membrane blebbing, as well as increased migration of the cellular clusters were seen. We have further studied the signal transduction pathways of HGF/c-Met in the H69 cell line. The stimulation of H69 with HGF (40 ng/ml, $>$24 h, maximal at 1 h) increased the amount of reactive oxygen species formed by 34\%. HGF stimulation (40 ng/ml, 7.5-min stimulation) of H69 cells showed increased tyrosine phosphorylated bands identified at Mr 68,000, 120,000\textendash{}140,000, and 200,000. Some of these tyrosine-phosphorylated bands were identified as the focal adhesion proteins paxillin, FAK, PYK2, and the c-Met receptor itself. Phospho-specific antibodies show that tyrosines at amino acid (a.a.) 31 of paxillin, and autophosphorylation sites at a.a. 397 of p125FAK, and a.a. 402 of PYK2 are phosphorylated in response to HGF/c-Met signaling. We also demonstrate that the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, which also affects c-Met, reduced the growth and viability of four of four SCLC cell lines by 25\% to 85\%, over a 72-h time period. Geldanamycin caused apoptosis of SCLC cells, as well as led to increased levels of Hsp70 but not Hsp90. These results demonstrate that c-Met/HGF pathway is functional in SCLC, and it would be useful to target this pathway toward novel therapy.},

Results: The c-MET mRNA copy number ranged from 1.18 \texttimes{} 102 to 1.11 \texttimes{} 106 copies (median 5.17 \texttimes{} 104) per 250 ng of RNA from CRC specimens. c-MET mRNA copies in CRC specimens was significantly higher than that from normal colon mucosal epithelium (P = 0.0001). c-MET mRNA copies significantly correlated with the depth of invasion: T1 versus T2, P = 0.007; T1 versus T3/T4, P = 0.0001; T1 versus T2 versus T3/T4, P = 0.0005; and T1/T2 versus T3/T4, P = 0.011. c-MET copy number in primary CRC of N1/N2 staged patients was significantly higher than N0 cases (P $<$ 0.03). Expression levels of c-MET mRNA were verified with immunohistochemistry analysis of c-MET protein expression in CRC specimens and normal mucosal epithelium. The VEGF-C mRNA copies of primary CRC assessed ranged from 0 to 1.65 \texttimes{} 105 copies (median 580). Although VEGF-C mRNA copies in CRC primary tumors were significantly higher than normal colon mucosal epithelium (P = 0.0008), it did not correlate with any major clinicopathological parameters of CRC.
Conclusions: This study indicates c-MET mRNA overexpression in primary CRC may be an important prognostic marker for early stage invasion and regional disease metastasis.},

\item 

The growth and motility factor hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and its receptor tyrosine kinase MET, the product of the \emph{MET} proto-oncogene, provide essential signals for survival and long-distance migration of epithelial and myogenic precursor cells during embryogenesis. Cancer cells hijack HGF/SF\textendash{}MET for invasion and metastasis, hence these molecules have emerged as key targets for cancer therapy.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$
                    
\item 

Aberrant MET activation occurs in many types of cancer, and results from multiple mechanisms. Many carcinomas overexpress MET and the surrounding stroma overexpresses HGF/SF. Furthermore, certain patients with renal papillary, hepatocellular or gastric carcinomas carry point mutations in \emph{MET}. These mutations have proved important in demonstrating a causal role of aberrant MET signalling in human cancer.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$
                    
\item 

The intracellular signalling cascades activated by MET include the PI3K\textendash{}AKT, RAC1\textendash{}cell division control protein 42 (CDC42), RAP1 and RAS\textendash{}MAPK pathways. An intricate network of cross-signalling involving the MET\textendash{}epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), MET\textendash{}vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and MET\textendash{}WNT pathways has also emerged in the past few years. This signalling network has major implications for therapy.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$
                    
\item 

Structural studies of HGF/SF, the MET ectodomain and the pathways involved in activation of the precursor form of HGF/SF (pro-HGF/SF) have yielded important results and new opportunities for therapeutic intervention, namely specific inhibitors of the major HGF/SF activators, HGF/SF fragments with antagonistic activity \textemdash{} such as NK4 \textemdash{} and HGF/SF and MET antibodies.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$
                    
\item 

Parallel efforts in the structural analysis of the MET kinase have led to extensive progress in the development of MET kinase inhibitors for cancer therapy, and three major classes of inhibitors have emerged from this work that differ in their binding mode, activity on MET kinase mutants and enzyme specificity.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$
                    
\item 

A number of recent clinical trials have demonstrated strong activity of MET inhibitors in patients with a variety of advanced or metastatic tumours, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and breast, prostate, liver and renal cancer. MET inhibitors have also displayed clinical benefits in patients with NSCLC and patients with breast cancer who had developed resistance to EGFR therapy. These recent data clearly indicate that HGF/SF\textendash{}MET therapeutics may have potential in several groups of cancer patients either alone or in combination with inhibitors of other signalling pathways.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

HGF/SF shares its overall domain structure with proteinases of the plasminogen family; the domain structure of Met is unique and its extracellular sequence is related to semaphorins and the semaphorin receptors (plexins).$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Met activation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor at a unique bidentate docking site in the carboxy-terminal end of Met, which recruits signalling molecules such as the scaffolding adaptor Gab1 (growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2)-associated binder 1). Gab1 mediates most of the complex cellular responses to Met activation.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

The juxtamembrane domain of Met contains an additional docking site that, when phosphorylated, recruits Cbl, a ubiquitin ligase, which results in Met ubiquitylation, endocytosis and degradation.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Met activation can induce proliferation, dissociation of epithelial cells (scattering) and motility. Furthermore, signals from Met elicit a complex morphogenic response \textemdash{} the formation of branched tubules from epithelial cells grown in a collagen matrix.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

During development, Met and HGF/SF are essential for the growth and survival of epithelial cell types and for migration of muscle progenitors. In adult physiology, Met activity prevents tissue damage and enhances liver regeneration.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

Receptor tyrosine kinases represent an important class of such therapeutic targets. c-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase that has been shown to be overexpressed and/or mutated in a variety of malignancies. A number of c-Met activating mutations, many of which are located in the tyrosine kinase domain, have been detected in various solid tumors and have been implicated in invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. It is known that stimulation of c-Met via its natural ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (also known as scatter factor, HGF/SF) results in a plethora of biological and biochemical effects in the cell. Activation of c-Met signaling can lead to scattering, angiogenesis, proliferation, enhanced cell motility, invasion, and eventual metastasis. In this review, the role of c-Met dysregulation in tumor progression and metastasis is discussed in detail with particular emphasis on c-Met mutations. Moreover, we summarize current knowledge on various pathways of c-Met signal transduction, highlighting the central role in the cytoskeletal functions. In this summary is included recent data in our laboratory indicating that phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins, such as paxillin, p125FAK, and PYK2, occurs in response to c-Met stimulation in lung cancer cells. Most importantly, current data on c-Met suggest that when mutated or overexpressed in malignant cells, c-Met would serve as an important therapeutic target.},

Anomalous c-Met signalling has been described in a variety of cancer types, and the receptor is regarded as a novel therapeutic target. In breast cancer there is a need to develop new treatments, particularly for the aggressive subtypes such as triple-negative and basal-like cancer, which currently lack targeted therapy. Over the last two decades, much has been learnt about the functional role of c-Met signalling in different models of breast development and cancer. This work has been complemented by clinical studies, establishing the prognostic significance of c-Met in tissue samples of breast cancer. While the clinical trials of anti-c-Met therapy in advanced breast cancer progress, there is a need to review the existing evidence so that the potential of these treatments can be better appreciated. The aim of this article is to examine the role of HGF/c-Met signalling in in vitro and in vivo models of breast cancer, to describe the mechanisms of aberrant c-Met signalling in human tissues, and to give a brief overview of the anti-c-Met therapies currently being evaluated in breast cancer patients. We will show that the HGF/c-Met pathway is associated with breast cancer progression and suggest that there is a firm basis for continued development of anti-c-Met treatment, particularly for patients with basal-like and triple-negative breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Summary
Background
Cabozantinib is an oral inhibitor of tyrosine kinases including MET, VEGFR, and AXL. The randomised phase 3 METEOR trial compared the efficacy and safety of cabozantinib versus the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who progressed after previous VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment. Here, we report the final overall survival results from this study based on an unplanned second interim analysis.
Methods
In this open-label, randomised phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients aged 18 years and older with advanced or metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, measurable disease, and previous treatment with one or more VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors to receive 60 mg cabozantinib once a day or 10 mg everolimus once a day. Randomisation was done with an interactive voice and web response system. Stratification factors were Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center risk group and the number of previous treatments with VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival as assessed by an independent radiology review committee in the first 375 randomly assigned patients and has been previously reported. Secondary endpoints were overall survival and objective response in all randomly assigned patients assessed by intention-to-treat. Safety was assessed per protocol in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The study is closed for enrolment but treatment and follow-up of patients is ongoing for long-term safety evaluation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01865747.
Findings
Between Aug 8, 2013, and Nov 24, 2014, 658 patients were randomly assigned to receive cabozantinib (n=330) or everolimus (n=328). The median duration of follow-up for overall survival and safety was 18$\cdot$7 months (IQR 16$\cdot$1\textendash{}21$\cdot$1) in the cabozantinib group and 18$\cdot$8 months (16$\cdot$0\textendash{}21$\cdot$2) in the everolimus group. Median overall survival was 21$\cdot$4 months (95\% CI 18$\cdot$7\textendash{}not estimable) with cabozantinib and 16$\cdot$5 months (14$\cdot$7\textendash{}18$\cdot$8) with everolimus (hazard ratio [HR] 0$\cdot$66 [95\% CI 0$\cdot$53\textendash{}0$\cdot$83]; p=0$\cdot$00026). Cabozantinib treatment also resulted in improved progression-free survival (HR 0$\cdot$51 [95\% CI 0$\cdot$41\textendash{}0$\cdot$62]; p$<$0$\cdot$0001) and objective response (17\% [13\textendash{}22] with cabozantinib vs 3\% [2\textendash{}6] with everolimus; p$<$0$\cdot$0001) per independent radiology review among all randomised patients. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hypertension (49 [15\%] in the cabozantinib group vs 12 [4\%] in the everolimus group), diarrhoea (43 [13\%] vs 7 [2\%]), fatigue (36 [11\%] vs 24 [7\%]), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (27 [8\%] vs 3 [1\%]), anaemia (19 [6\%] vs 53 [17\%]), hyperglycaemia (3 [1\%] vs 16 [5\%]), and hypomagnesaemia (16 [5\%] vs none). Serious adverse events grade 3 or worse occurred in 130 (39\%) patients in the cabozantinib group and in 129 (40\%) in the everolimus group. One treatment-related death occurred in the cabozantinib group (death; not otherwise specified) and two occurred in the everolimus group (one aspergillus infection and one pneumonia aspiration).
Interpretation
Treatment with cabozantinib increased overall survival, delayed disease progression, and improved the objective response compared with everolimus. Based on these results, cabozantinib should be considered as a new standard-of-care treatment option for previously treated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Patients should be monitored for adverse events that might require dose modifications.

Final analysis of overall survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint, was carried out after long-term follow-up.Patients and methodsEXAM compared cabozantinib with placebo in 330 patients with documented radiographic progression of metastatic MTC. Patients were randomized (2:1) to cabozantinib (140\,mg/day) or placebo. Final OS and updated safety data are reported.ResultsMinimum follow-up was 42\,months. Kaplan\textendash{}Meier analysis showed a 5.5-month increase in median OS with cabozantinib versus placebo (26.6 versus 21.1\,months) although the difference did not reach statistical significance [stratified hazard ratio (HR), 0.85; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.64\textendash{}1.12; P\,=\,0.24].

For patients with RET M918T-positive disease, median OS was 44.3\,months for cabozantinib versus 18.9\,months for placebo [HR, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.38\textendash{}0.94; P\,=\,0.03 (not adjusted for multiple subgroup analyses)], with corresponding values of 20.2 versus 21.5\,months (HR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 0.70\textendash{}1.82; P\,=\,0.63) in the RET M918T\textendash{}negative subgroup. Median treatment duration was 10.8\,months with cabozantinib and 3.4\,months with placebo. The safety profile for cabozantinib remained consistent with that of the primary analysis.ConclusionThe secondary end point was not met in this final OS analysis from the trial of cabozantinib in patients with metastatic, radiographically progressive MTC. A statistically nonsignificant increase in OS was observed for cabozantinib compared with placebo.

  abstract = {Summary
Background
RET rearrangements are found in 1\textendash{}2\% of non-small-cell lung cancers. Cabozantinib is a multikinase inhibitor with activity against RET that produced a 10\% overall response in unselected patients with lung cancers. To assess the activity of cabozantinib in patients with RET-rearranged lung cancers, we did a prospective phase 2 trial in this molecular subgroup.
Methods
We enrolled patients in this open-label, Simon two-stage, single-centre, phase 2, single-arm trial in the USA if they met the following criteria: metastatic or unresectable lung cancer harbouring a RET rearrangement, Karnofsky performance status higher than 70, and measurable disease. Patients were given 60 mg of cabozantinib orally per day. The primary objective was to determine the overall response (Response Criteria Evaluation in Solid Tumors version 1.1) in assessable patients; those who received at least one dose of cabozantinib, and had been given CT imaging at baseline and at least one protocol-specified follow-up timepoint. We did safety analyses in the modified intention-to-treat population who received at least one dose of cabozantinib. The accrual of patients with RET-rearranged lung cancer to this protocol has been completed but the trial is still ongoing because several patients remain on active treatment. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01639508.
Findings
Between July 13, 2012, and April 30, 2016, 26 patients with RET-rearranged lung adenocarcinomas were enrolled and given cabozantinib; 25 patients were assessable for a response. KIF5B-RET was the predominant fusion type identified in 16 (62\%) patients. The study met its primary endpoint, with confirmed partial responses seen in seven of 25 response-assessable patients (overall response 28\%, 95\% CI 12\textendash{}49). Of the 26 patients given cabozantinib, the most common grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were lipase elevation in four (15\%) patients, increased alanine aminotransferase in two (8\%) patients, increased aspartate aminotransferase in two (8\%) patients, decreased platelet count in two (8\%) patients, and hypophosphataemia in two (8\%) patients. No drug-related deaths were recorded but 16 (62\%) patients died during the course of follow-up. 19 (73\%) patients required dose reductions due to drug-related adverse events.
Interpretation
The reported activity of cabozantinib in patients with RET-rearranged lung cancers defines RET rearrangements as actionable drivers in patients with lung cancers. An improved understanding of tumour biology and novel therapeutic approaches will be needed to improve outcomes with RET-directed targeted treatment.

  abstract = {Purpose: Rearranged ROS1 is a crizotinib-sensitive oncogenic driver in lung cancer. The development of acquired resistance, however, poses a serious clinical challenge. Consequently, experimental and clinical validation of resistance mechanisms and potential second-line therapies is essential.
Experimental Design: We report the discovery of a novel, solvent-front ROS1D2033N mutation in a patient with CD74-ROS1\textendash{}rearranged lung adenocarcinoma and acquired resistance to crizotinib. Crizotinib resistance of CD74-ROS1D2033N was functionally evaluated using cell-based assays and structural modeling.
Results: In biochemical and cell-based assays, the CD74-ROS1D2033N mutant demonstrated significantly decreased sensitivity to crizotinib. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed compromised crizotinib binding due to drastic changes in the electrostatic interaction between the D2033 residue and crizotinib and reorientation of neighboring residues. In contrast, cabozantinib binding was unaffected by the D2033N substitution, and inhibitory potency against the mutant was retained. Notably, cabozantinib treatment resulted in a rapid clinical and near-complete radiographic response in this patient.
Conclusions: These results provide the first example of successful therapeutic intervention with targeted therapy to overcome crizotinib resistance in a ROS1-rearranged cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 22(10); 2351\textendash{}8. \textcopyright{}2015 AACR.},

  abstract = {6012  Background:  Cabo inhibits tyrosine kinases including MET, VEGFR2, and RET. EXAM, a randomized double-blind placebo (P)-controlled study in patients (pts) with progressive, locally advanced, or metastatic MTC (NCT00704730), met its primary end point with a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28, p $<$ 0.001) (Elisei et al, JCO, 2013). This report contains the final analysis of the secondary endpoint, Overall Survival (OS).  Methods:  Eligible pts were required to have documented RECIST progression within 14 months (mo) of screening, and were randomized 2:1 to receive Cabo (140 mg qd) or P. Crossover between treatment arms was not allowed. The primary endpoint was PFS assessed by RECIST via independent review. The study was designed with 80\% power to detect a HR of 0.667 for the secondary endpoint of OS.   Results:  At the final analysis, median follow up time was 52.4 mo. 218 events were recorded in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (N = 330). The estimated median OS was 26.6 mo for Cabo vs 21.1 mo for P (stratified HR = 0.85; 95\% CI 0.64-1.12; p  =  0.241). For 126 pts with known RET M918T mutations, median OS was 44.3 mo for Cabo vs 18.9 mo for P (HR = 0.60, p = 0.026). 32\% of Cabo-treated pts received subsequent systemic anticancer therapy vs 50\% for P-treated pts. The median duration of treatment was 10.8 mo for Cabo and 3.5 mo for P. 46\% and 26\% of Cabo-treated pts remained on study treatment for over 1 year and 2 years, and 10\% and 1.8\% for P, respectively. The most common serious adverse events ( $\geq$ 2\%) on the Cabo arm were pneumonia (4.2\%), pulmonary embolism (3.3\%), mucosal inflammation (2.8\%), hypocalcemia (2.8\%), hypertension, dysphagia, dehydration and lung abscess (2.3\% each).  Conclusions:  The secondary endpoint of improved OS was not met, with a median OS 5.5 mo longer with Cabo compared to P that did not reach significance in the ITT population. OS improvement with Cabo was greatest in patients with RET M918T mutations, with a 25.4-month increase in median OS compared to P. The safety profile of Cabo remained consistent with longer term exposure. Clinical trial information: NCT00704730.},

  abstract = {9068Background: The RET inhibitor cabozantinib is active in pts with RET-rearranged lung cancers. We previously reported an overall response rate of 38\% on an ongoing phase 2 study (Drilon ASCO 2015), implying that a proportion of tumors may harbor intrinsic resistance. Furthermore, tumors that respond eventually progress due to the development of secondary resistance. Molecular mechanisms that underlie resistance to cabozantinib are poorly understood. Methods: Paired pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies were obtained from pts with RET-rearranged lung cancers treated with cabozantinib on our phase 2 trial (NCT01639508) or off-protocol. Broad, hybrid-capture NGS (MSK-IMPACT/FoundationOne) was performed to identify concurrent genomic alterations. RET-rearranged cell lines and xenografts were treated with cabozantinib and the MDM2 inhibitors AMG232 and RG7388. Results: NGS was performed on 16 pre- and 6 post-cabozantinib tumor samples. De-novo MDM2 (p53 antagonist) amp or TP53 mutation were identified in pre-treatment tumors from 8/16 (50\%) pts. Acquired MDM2 amp was identified in post-cabozantinib recurrences from 2/4 (50\%) pts with paired samples who developed resistance. In a separate group of 3,842 lung cancer pts, NGS detected concurrent MDM2 amp in 20\% of tumors with RET fusions (p $<$ 0.01). A cell line and xenograft were established from a pt with a TRIM33-RET+ tumor that developed acquired MDM2 amp after progression on cabozantinib. MDM2 inhibitors reduced cell line growth (IC50 0.07$\mathrm{\mu}$M AMG232, 0.02$\mathrm{\mu}$M RG7388), induced expression of p53-dependent genes, and activated caspase 3/7 in a p53- and PUMA-dependent manner. Growth was suppressed 60-90\% by shRNAs targeting MDM2. Xenograft treatment with AMG232 or RG7388 resulted in 60-90\% tumor volume reduction. A combination of cabozantinib and AMG232 was more effective at suppressing tumor growth than either agent alone. Ectopic MDM2 expression in NIH-3T3 cells transformed with CCDC6-RET resulted in reduced cabozantinib sensitivity. Conclusions: MDM2 amplification is a potential mechanism of primary or acquired resistance to cabozantinib. MDM2 inhibitors in clinical development can be employed as viable targeted therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Therapeutic targeting of the epithelial compartment alone in prostate cancer has resulted in unfavorable outcomes, including the development of resistance. Cabozantinib (XL184), a small molecule inhibitor of tyrosine kinases including c-MET and VEGFR2 has been shown to decrease tumor growth and metastasis. Our working rationale is that therapeutic strategies that target the prostate tumor microenvironment would have improved outcomes compared with those that solely target the cancer epithelia. Cabozantinib is demonstrated to have a role in inhibiting osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation and thereby limit prostate cancer (PCa) bone lesions, as determined by technetium-99 bone scan. However, the ultimate survival benefit of castrate resistant prostate cancer patients treated with cabozantinib has not born out in recent clinical trials for PCa patients with bone metastasis. In this study, utilizing various pre-clinical xenograft mouse models, prostate epithelial cell lines and human and mouse prostate fibroblasts, we investigated the effect of cabozantinib on prostate tumor microenvironment and delineated the cellular targets of cabozantnib. We found that cabozantinib affects prostate stromal cells at a significantly lower concentration compared with epithelial cells in vitro. We found that human cancer associated fibroblasts pre-treated with cabozantinib induced a significantly increased tumor growth in the intra-tibial mouse model of growth in the bone microenvironment. Further, in a novel and surprising discovery, we found that cabozantinib alters the immune microenvironment by reducing the M1 macrophages. However, cabozantinib depleted both basal and luminal epithelial progenitor cells in vivo. Taken together, we found that cabozantnib can have a tumor potentiating role by limiting M1 macrophages, yet the down regulation of carcinoma associated fibroblasts and associated epithelial progenitors could suggest interesting combination therapies. A lower dose of cabozantnib with traditional anti-proliferative therapies, like taxanes or radiation is supported by the pre-clinical experiments.

  abstract = {PurposeCabozantinib is an oral potent inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, MET, and AXL and is a standard second-line therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). This randomized phase II multicenter trial evaluated cabozantinib compared with sunitinib as first-line therapy in patients with mRCC.Patients and MethodsEligible patients had untreated clear cell mRCC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 and were intermediate or poor risk per International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium criteria. Patients were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to cabozantinib (60 mg once per day) or sunitinib (50 mg once per day; 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off). Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end point. Objective response rate (ORR), overall survival, and safety were secondary end points.ResultsFrom July 2013 to April 2015, 157 patients were randomly assigned (cabozantinib, n = 79; sunitinib, n = 78). Compared with sunitinib, cabozantinib treatment significantly increased median PFS (8.2 v 5.6 months) and was associated with a 34\% reduction in rate of progression or death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.46 to 0.95; one-sided P = .012). ORR was 33\% (95\% CI, 23\% to 44\%) for cabozantinib versus 12\% (95\% CI, 5.4\% to 21\%) for sunitinib. All-causality grade 3 or 4 adverse events were 67\% for cabozantinib and 68\% for sunitinib and included diarrhea (cabozantinib, 10\% v sunitinib, 11\%), fatigue (6\% v 15\%), hypertension (28\% v 22\%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (8\% v 4\%), and hematologic adverse events (3\% v 22\%).ConclusionCabozantinib demonstrated a significant clinical benefit in PFS and ORR over standard-of-care sunitinib as first-line therapy in patients with intermediate- or poor-risk mRCC.},
