  abstract = {Technical variation plays an important role in microarray-based gene expression studies, and batch effects explain a large proportion of this noise. It is therefore mandatory to eliminate technical variation while maintaining biological variability. Several strategies have been proposed for the removal of batch effects, although they have not been evaluated in large-scale longitudinal gene expression data. In this study, we aimed at identifying a suitable method for batch effect removal in a large study of microarray-based longitudinal gene expression. Monocytic gene expression was measured in 1092 participants of the Gutenberg Health Study at baseline and 5-year follow up. Replicates of selected samples were measured at both time points to identify technical variability. Deming regression, Passing-Bablok regression, linear mixed models, non-linear models as well as ReplicateRUV and ComBat were applied to eliminate batch effects between replicates. In a second step, quantile normalization prior to batch effect correction was performed for each method. Technical variation between batches was evaluated by principal component analysis. Associations between body mass index and transcriptomes were calculated before and after batch removal. Results from association analyses were compared to evaluate maintenance of biological variability. Quantile normalization, separately performed in each batch, combined with ComBat successfully reduced batch effects and maintained biological variability. ReplicateRUV performed perfectly in the replicate data subset of the study, but failed when applied to all samples. All other methods did not substantially reduce batch effects in the replicate data subset. Quantile normalization plus ComBat appears to be a valuable approach for batch correction in longitudinal gene expression data.},

Transforming the data to remove these differences has the potential to remove interesting biologically driven global variation and therefore may not be appropriate depending on the type and source of variation.

\begin{itemize}

\item Using house-keeping genes to normalize did not work. 

\item Hypothesis of most techniques: Assume observed variability in global properties are due to only technical reasons and are unrelated to biology of interest.

\begin{itemize}

\item Total \# of DE genes across groups

\item Median gene expression across genes

\item Statistical distribution of gene expression values

\textbf{If a substantially higher percentage of genes are expected to be expressed in only one group of samples, it may not be appropriate to use global adjustment methods. }}

It is generally inappropriate to combine datasets without adjusting for batch effects.

\textbf{Model / Algorithm}

Assumes batch effects can be modeled out by standardizing means and variances across batches. Adjustments can be gene-wise standardization to complex linear / non-linear adjustments.

\textbf{L/S Model (Location/Scale, which means mean/variance)}

Y\_ijg = a\_g + X * B\_g + y\_ig + delta\_ig * epsilon\_ijg

Y\_ijg = Counts for gene g, sample j, batch i

a\_g = overall gene expression for gene g

X = design matrix for sample conditions

B\_g~ = Vector of regression coefficients corresponding to X

y\_ig = Additive batch effects of batch i for gene g

delta\_ig = Multiplicative batch effects of batch gene g

epsilon\_ijg = Error term following a normal distribution w/ expected value of zero and

\textbf{Steps}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Standardize the data}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Standardize the data gene-wise so genes have similar mean and variance. This corrects for magnitude of expression values, which for RNA-seq is sequencing depth.

\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{EB batch effect parameter estimates using parametric emprical priors}

\item \textbf{Adjust the data for batch effects}

  abstract = {The expression microarray is a frequently used approach to study gene expression on a genome-wide scale. However, the data produced by the thousands of microarray studies published annually are confounded by ``batch effects,'' the systematic error introduced when samples are processed in multiple batches. Although batch effects can be reduced by careful experimental design, they cannot be eliminated unless the whole study is done in a single batch. A number of programs are now available to adjust microarray data for batch effects prior to analysis. We systematically evaluated six of these programs using multiple measures of precision, accuracy and overall performance. ComBat, an Empirical Bayes method, outperformed the other five programs by most metrics. We also showed that it is essential to standardize expression data at the probe level when testing for correlation of expression profiles, due to a sizeable probe effect in microarray data that can inflate the correlation among replicates and unrelated samples.},

Projecting as an evolutionary step, following the transition from mainframe computers to client/server deployment models, cloud computing encompasses elements from grid computing, utility computing and autonomic computing, into an innovative deployment architecture. This rapid transition towards the clouds, has fuelled concerns on a critical issue for the success of information systems, communication and information security. From a security perspective, a number of unchartered risks and challenges have been introduced from this relocation to the clouds, deteriorating much of the effectiveness of traditional protection mechanisms. As a result the aim of this paper is twofold; firstly to evaluate cloud security by identifying unique security requirements and secondly to attempt to present a viable solution that eliminates these potential threats. This paper proposes introducing a Trusted Third Party, tasked with assuring specific security characteristics within a cloud environment. The proposed solution calls upon cryptography, specifically Public Key Infrastructure operating in concert with SSO and LDAP, to ensure the authentication, integrity and confidentiality of involved data and communications. The solution, presents a horizontal level of service, available to all implicated entities, that realizes a security mesh, within which essential trust is maintained.},

  doi = {10.1109/BigDataCongress.2015.47},
  abstract = {Genomic data is growing exponentially due to next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) and their ability to produce massive amounts of data in a short time. NGS technologies generate big genomic data that needs to be exchanged between different locations efficiently and reliably. The current network transfer protocols rely on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Data gram Protocol (UDP) protocols, ignoring data size and type. Universal application layer protocols such as HTTP are designed for wide variety of data types and are not particularly efficient for genomic data. Therefore, we present a new data-aware transfer protocol for genomic-data that increases network throughput and reduces latency, called Genomic Text Transfer Protocol (GTTP). In this paper, we design and implement a new network transfer protocol for big genomic DNA dataset that relies on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Modification to content-encoding of HTTP has been done that would transfer big genomic DNA datasets using machine-to-machine (M2M) and client(s)-server topologies. Our results show that our modification to HTTP reduces the transmitted data by 75\% of original data and still be able to regenerate the data at the client side for bioinformatics analysis. Consequently, the transfer of data using GTTP is shown to be much faster (about 8 times faster than HTTP) when compared with regular HTTP.},

  abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS\textemdash{}the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases\textemdash{}make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

  abstract = {Detection of somatic point substitutions is a key step in characterizing the cancer genome. However, existing methods typically miss low-allelic-fraction mutations that occur in only a subset of the sequenced cells owing to either tumor heterogeneity or contamination by normal cells. Here we present MuTect, a method that applies a Bayesian classifier to detect somatic mutations with very low allele fractions, requiring only a few supporting reads, followed by carefully tuned filters that ensure high specificity. We also describe benchmarking approaches that use real, rather than simulated, sequencing data to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity as a function of sequencing depth, base quality and allelic fraction. Compared with other methods, MuTect has higher sensitivity with similar specificity, especially for mutations with allelic fractions as low as 0.1 and below, making MuTect particularly useful for studying cancer subclones and their evolution in standard exome and genome sequencing data.

  abstract = {A new and conceptually simple data structure, called a suffix array, for on-line string searches is introduced in this paper. Constructing and querying suffix arrays is reduced to a sort and search paradigm that employs novel algorithms. The main advantage of suffix arrays over suffix trees is that, in practice, they use three to five times less space. From a complexity standpoint, suffix arrays permit on-line string searches of the type, ``Is W a substring of A?'' to be answered in time \$O(P + $\backslash$log N)\$, where P is the length of W and N is the length of A, which is competitive with (and in some cases slightly better than) suffix trees. The only drawback is that in those instances where the underlying alphabet is finite and small, suffix trees can be constructed in \$O(N)\$ time in the worst case, versus \$O(N$\backslash$log N)\$ time for suffix arrays. However, an augmented algorithm is given that, regardless of the alphabet size, constructs suffix arrays in \$O(N)\$expected time, albeit with lesser space efficiency. It is believed that suffix arrays will prove to be better in practice than suffix trees for many applications.},

Here, we show that usual normalization approaches mostly account for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library preparation and other more complex unwanted technical effects. We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.},

Although batch effect-correction algorithms (BECAs) exist, we know little about effective batch-effect mitigation: even now, new batch effect-associated problems are emerging. These include false effects due to misapplying BECAs and positive bias during model evaluations. Depending on the choice of algorithm and experimental set-up, biological heterogeneity can be mistaken for batch effects and wrongfully removed. Here, we examine these emerging batch effect-associated problems, propose a series of best practices, and discuss some of the challenges that lie ahead.},

We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high-dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularisation for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for randomised Lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions needed for consistency of the original Lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

  abstract = {Cell surface proteins are major targets of biomedical research due to their utility as cellular markers and their extracellular accessibility for pharmacological intervention. However, information about the cell surface protein repertoire (the surfaceome) of individual cells is only sparsely available. Here, we applied the Cell Surface Capture (CSC) technology to 41 human and 31 mouse cell types to generate a mass-spectrometry derived Cell Surface Protein Atlas (CSPA) providing cellular surfaceome snapshots at high resolution. The CSPA is presented in form of an easy-to-navigate interactive database, a downloadable data matrix and with tools for targeted surfaceome rediscovery (http://wlab.ethz.ch/cspa). The cellular surfaceome snapshots of different cell types, including cancer cells, resulted in a combined dataset of 1492 human and 1296 mouse cell surface glycoproteins, providing experimental evidence for their cell surface expression on different cell types, including 136 G-protein coupled receptors and 75 membrane receptor tyrosine-protein kinases. Integrated analysis of the CSPA reveals that the concerted biological function of individual cell types is mainly guided by quantitative rather than qualitative surfaceome differences. The CSPA will be useful for the evaluation of drug targets, for the improved classification of cell types and for a better understanding of the surfaceome and its concerted biological functions in complex signaling microenvironments.},

  doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btp692},
  abstract = {Motivation: RNA-Seq is a promising new technology for accurately measuring gene expression levels. Expression estimation with RNA-Seq requires the mapping of relatively short sequencing reads to a reference genome or transcript set. Because reads are generally shorter than transcripts from which they are derived, a single read may map to multiple genes and isoforms, complicating expression analyses. Previous computational methods either discard reads that map to multiple locations or allocate them to genes heuristically., Results: We present a generative statistical model and associated inference methods that handle read mapping uncertainty in a principled manner. Through simulations parameterized by real RNA-Seq data, we show that our method is more accurate than previous methods. Our improved accuracy is the result of handling read mapping uncertainty with a statistical model and the estimation of gene expression levels as the sum of isoform expression levels. Unlike previous methods, our method is capable of modeling non-uniform read distributions. Simulations with our method indicate that a read length of 20\textendash{}25 bases is optimal for gene-level expression estimation from mouse and maize RNA-Seq data when sequencing throughput is fixed., Availability: An initial C++ implementation of our method that was used for the results presented in this article is available at http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/rsem., Contact: cdewey@biostat.wisc.edu, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics on},

Epigenetic profiles showed substantial heterogeneity, including an IDH1 mutant subset with a methylator phenotype. Androgen receptor (AR) activity varied widely and in a subtype-specific manner, with SPOP and FOXA1 mutant tumors having the highest levels of AR-induced transcripts. 25\% of the prostate cancers had a presumed actionable lesion in the PI3K or MAPK signaling pathways, and DNA repair genes were inactivated in 19\%.

Chimeric humanised and fully humanised mAb can now be made by recombinant engineering. About a quarter of all biotech drugs in development are mAb, and around 30 products are in use or being investigated. Licensed products are available for inhibition of alloimmune and autoimmune reactivity, and for antitumour, antiplatelet, or antiviral therapy. Short-term side-effects are tolerable and as expected, although long-term safety remains to be elucidated. The cost-effectiveness and quality-of-life benefits of the use of mAb in patients who are usually seriously and chronically ill also needs studying. The therapeutic use of mAb is now established, and is perhaps the first example of how the ``new biology'' and the understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms has benefited patients.},

  doi = {10.1517/14728222.12.3.341},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Expression of CD70, a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, is restricted to activated T and B lymphocytes and mature dendritic cells. CD70 has also been detected on hematological tumors and on carcinomas. The restricted expression pattern of CD70 in normal tissues and its widespread expression in various malignancies makes it an attractive target for antibody-based therapeutics. Investigations to exploit CD70 as a cancer target have lead to the identification of potential antibody-based clinical candidates. Anti-CD70 antibodies for therapeutic use have been developed and used to validate CD70 as a target for cancers. Antibodies are also used as a vehicle to deliver potent cytotoxic drugs to target CD70+ malignant cells. Both unconjugated antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates targeting CD70 have been tested in animal models of human cancers.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the expression of CD70 in cancer cells and the development of antibody-based therapies against CD70.
METHODS: A review of the available literature.
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Humanized anti-CD70 antibodies have shown significant antitumor activity in preclinical xenograft models of cancer. Additionally, anti-CD70 antibody-drug conjugates exhibit potent antitumor activity in solid tumor xenograft models, confirming increased therapeutic efficacy through cytotoxic drug delivery. Thus, preclinical animal models have provided strong evidence that targeting CD70 either with unconjugated antibodies or with antibody-drug conjugates represents a promising approach to treat human malignancies.},

  abstract = {Genomic characterization used in pediatric cancer clinical trials is limited to the detection of somatic mutations and gene fusions in well-characterized cancer genes. However, these approaches do not reveal actionable therapeutic targets for the majority of pediatric cancer patients. Incorporation of gene expression information into clinical genomic analysis is hindered by the lack of appropriate computational methods, designed for single patients rather than patient cohorts. UC Santa Cruz Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative (treehousegenomics.soe.ucsc.edu) enables the incorporation of gene expression information into the genomic evaluation of pediatric cancer patients. We leverage large cancer RNA sequencing datasets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas, Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments, Medulloblastoma Advanced Genomics International Consortium, International Cancer Genome Consortium, and published research and clinical studies. Through our ``pan-cancer analysis'', we compare each prospective tumor's RNA sequencing and/or mutational profile to over 11,000 uniformly analyzed tumor profiles using our Tumor Map method. Tumor Map visualizes single tumors together with the reference compendium and identifies samples that are most similar to the given tumor based on the gene expression profiles. We also developed a gene expression outlier analysis to identify transcripts that are over expressed in the given tumor. These pan-cancer gene expression analyses are used in conjunction with mutation data to nominate molecular pathways that may be driving the disease in each child, providing useful information to the medical teams. We aim to evaluate this approach in partnership with pediatric cancer clinical genomic trials at Stanford University, UC San Francisco, Children's Hospital of Orange County, University of Michigan, Children's Mercy Hospital, and British Columbia Children's Hospital. The analysis of the first 27 patients at Stanford, most with refractory solid tumors, provided evidence of the potential clinical utility of incorporating gene expression information into the genomic evaluation of pediatric cancer patients. In all cases, we identified candidate driver molecular pathways that could be targeted by existing FDA-approved therapies or therapies available through a clinical trial. The most frequently identified molecular targets were receptor tyrosine kinases and cyclin-dependent kinases. For 3 patients with no treatment options prior to our work, the analysis contributed to treatment decisions. This study provides a framework for incorporating gene expression information into the clinical interpretation of pediatric cancer genomic data. We underscore the importance of releasing the data to the community immediately following generation, so that they may benefit new patients.

  abstract = {Purpose: A phase I peptide vaccination trial was done in patients with progressive cytokine-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to assess both the toxicity and capability to induce immune responses of three peptides (CA9p219-227, p288-296, and p323-331) derived from CA9, a tumor-associated antigen ubiquitously expressed in RCC.
Experimental Design: Twenty-three patients positive for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A24 with histologically confirmed RCC were enrolled. Eligibility included progressive disease after standard cytokine therapy with interleukin-2 and/or IFN-$\alpha$. Patients were vaccinated s.c. with the three peptides emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 2-week intervals. Pre- and post-vaccination blood samples were obtained for toxicity assessment and immunologic studies. Patients were monitored for clinical responses on a 3-monthly basis.
Results: Vaccinations were well tolerated without any major adverse event. Most of the patients developed peptide-specific CTLs and/or immunoglobulin G reactive to the peptides after the 6th or 9th vaccination, followed by a gradual increase in both CTL frequency and levels of peptide-reactive serum IgG. Three patients with multiple lung metastases showed partial responses with disappearance and shrinking of metastatic lesions. Additionally, stable disease for $>$6 months was observed in six patients (median duration, 12.2 months). Moreover, the median survival time of all patients who were progressive at trial enrollment after failing immunotherapy was 21.0 months (5-35 months).
Conclusions: These results suggest that vaccination of these peptides is safe and recommended for further trials for HLA-A24-positive metastatic RCC patients.},

Here we focus on the problem of detecting gene fusions from raw sequencing data, assembling the reads to define fusion transcripts and their associated breakpoints, and quantifying their abundances. Building on the pseudoalignment idea that simplifies and accelerates transcript quantification, we introduce a novel approach to fusion detection based on inspecting paired reads that cannot be pseudoaligned due to conflicting matches. The method and software, called pizzly, filters false positives, assembles new transcripts from the fusion reads, and reports candidate fusions. With pizzly, fusion detection from raw RNA-Seq reads can be performed in a matter of minutes, making the program suitable for the analysis of large cancer gene expression databases and for clinical use. pizzly is available at https://github.com/pmelsted/pizzly},

Many different experimental features can cause biases including different sources of RNA, different production lots of microarrays or different microarray platforms.

Our approach is based on modern statistical discrimination methods and is shown to be very effective in removing systematic biases present in a previously published breast tumor cDNA microarray data set. The new method of `Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD)' is shown to be better than Support Vector Machines and Singular Value Decomposition for the adjustment of systematic microarray effects. In addition, it is shown to be of general use as a tool for the discrimination of systematic problems present in microarray data sets, including the merging of two breast tumor data sets completed on different microarray platforms.Availability: Matlab software to perform DWD can be retrieved from https://genome.unc.edu/pubsup/dwd/Supplementary information: The complete figures that represent the cluster diagrams in Figure 6 and other figures are available at https://genome.unc.edu/pubsup/dwd/},

The analysis of such experiments is nontrivial because of large data size and many levels of variation introduced at different stages of the experiments. The analysis is further complicated by the large differences that may exist among different probes used to interrogate the same gene. However, an attractive feature of high-density oligonucleotide arrays such as those produced by photolithography and inkjet technology is the standardization of chip manufacturing and hybridization process. As a result, probe-specific biases, although significant, are highly reproducible and predictable, and their adverse effect can be reduced by proper modeling and analysis methods. Here, we propose a statistical model for the probe-level data, and develop model-based estimates for gene expression indexes. We also present model-based methods for identifying and handling cross-hybridizing probes and contaminating array regions. Applications of these results will be presented elsewhere.},

Previous work focused mainly on the development of methods for effective batch effects removal.

This paper uses a broad selection of data sets from the Microarray Quality Control Phase II (MAQC-II) effort, generated on three microarray platforms with different causes of batch effects to assess the efficacy of their removal. Two data sets from cross-tissue and cross-platform experiments are also included. Of the 120 cases studied using Support vector machines (SVM) and K nearest neighbors (KNN) as classifiers and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) as performance metric, we find that Ratio-G, Ratio-A, EJLR, mean-centering and standardization methods perform better or equivalent to no batch effect removal in 89, 85, 83, 79 and 75\% of the cases, respectively, suggesting that the application of these methods is generally advisable and ratio-based methods are preferred.},

\subsubsection{Background$<$/h3$>$ The number of gene expression studies in the public domain is rapidly increasing, representing a highly valuable resource. However, dataset-specific bias precludes meta-analysis at the raw transcript level, even when the RNA is from comparable sources and has been processed on the same microarray platform using similar protocols. Here, we demonstrate, using Affymetrix data, that much of this bias can be removed, allowing multiple datasets to be legitimately combined for meaningful meta-analyses. 

\subsubsection{Results$<$/h3$>$ A series of validation datasets comparing breast cancer and normal breast cell lines (MCF7 and MCF10A) were generated to examine the variability between datasets generated using different amounts of starting RNA, alternative protocols, different generations of Affymetrix GeneChip or scanning hardware. We demonstrate that systematic, multiplicative biases are introduced at the RNA, hybridization and image-capture stages of a microarray experiment. Simple batch mean-centering was found to significantly reduce the level of inter-experimental variation, allowing raw transcript levels to be compared across datasets with confidence. By accounting for dataset-specific bias, we were able to assemble the largest gene expression dataset of primary breast tumours to-date (1107), from six previously published studies. Using this meta-dataset, we demonstrate that combining greater numbers of datasets or tumours leads to a greater overlap in differentially expressed genes and more accurate prognostic predictions. However, this is highly dependent upon the composition of the datasets and patient characteristics. 

\subsubsection{Conclusion$<$/h3$>$ Multiplicative, systematic biases are introduced at many stages of microarray experiments. When these are reconciled, raw data can be directly integrated from different gene expression datasets leading to new biological findings with increased statistical power.}

  abstract = {MotivationSources of variability in experimentally derived data include measurement error in addition to the physical phenomena of interest. This measurement error is a combination of systematic components, originating from the measuring instrument and random measurement errors. Several novel biological technologies, such as mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), are plagued with systematic errors that may severely affect statistical analysis if the data are not properly calibrated.ResultsWe propose a novel deep learning approach for removing systematic batch effects. Our method is based on a residual neural network, trained to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between the multivariate distributions of two replicates, measured in different batches. We apply our method to mass cytometry and scRNA-seq datasets, and demonstrate that it effectively attenuates batch effects.Availability and Implementationour codes and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ushaham/BatchEffectRemoval.gitContactyuval.kluger@yale.eduSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%\textendash{}40\% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to $>$85\% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve $>$85\% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at $\lessequivlnt$5\% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.},

A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these identity mappings. This motivates us to propose a new residual unit, which makes training easier and improves generalization.

  abstract = {Motivation: Many problems in data integration in bioinformatics can be posed as one common question: Are two sets of observations generated by the same distribution? We propose a kernel-based statistical test for this problem, based on the fact that two distributions are different if and only if there exists at least one function having different expectation on the two distributions. Consequently we use the maximum discrepancy between function means as the basis of a test statistic.The Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) can take advantage of the kernel trick, which allows us to apply it not only to vectors, but strings, sequences, graphs, and other common structured data types arising in molecular biology.Results: We study the practical feasibility of an MMD-based test on three central data integration tasks: Testing cross-platform comparability of microarray data, cancer diagnosis, and data-content based schema matching for two different protein function classification schemas. In all of these experiments, including high-dimensional ones, MMD is very accurate in finding samples that were generated from the same distribution, and outperforms its best competitors.Conclusions: We have defined a novel statistical test of whether two samples are from the same distribution, compatible with both multivariate and structured data, that is fast, easy to implement, and works well, as confirmed by our experiments.Availability:Contact:kb@dbs.ifi.lmu.de},

However, projects are generating ever-larger data sets comprising RNA-Seq data from hundreds or thousands of samples, often collected at multiple centers and from diverse tissues. These complex data sets present significant analytical challenges due to batch and tissue effects, but provide the opportunity to revisit the assumptions and methods that we use to preprocess, normalize, and filter RNA-Seq data - critical first steps for any subsequent analysis.

Here we overcome this limitation by targeting CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to exons encoding functional protein domains. This generates a higher proportion of null mutations and substantially increases the potency of negative selection. We also show that the magnitude of negative selection can be used to infer the functional importance of individual protein domains of interest. A screen of 192 chromatin regulatory domains in murine acute myeloid leukemia cells identifies six known drug targets and 19 additional dependencies. A broader application of this approach may allow comprehensive identification of protein domains that sustain cancer cells and are suitable for drug targeting.},

While the extent of genetic variability in classical pharmacokinetic genes is rather well understood, the role of genetic variation in drug targets is typically less studied. Based on 60,706 human exomes from the ExAC dataset, we performed an in-depth computational analysis of the prevalence of functional-variants in in 806 drug-related genes, including 628 known drug targets. We find that most genetic variants in these genes are very rare (f $<$ 0.1\%) and thus likely not observed in clinical trials. Overall, however, four in five patients are likely to carry a functional-variant in a target for commonly prescribed drugs and many of these might alter drug efficacy. We further computed the likelihood of 1,236 FDA approved drugs to be affected by functional-variants in their targets and show that the patient-risk varies for many drugs with respect to geographic ancestry. A focused analysis of oncological drug targets indicates that the probability of a patient carrying germline variants in oncological drug targets is with 44\% high enough to suggest that not only somatic alterations, but also germline variants carried over into the tumor genome should be included in therapeutic decision-making.},

Tremendous effort and progress has been made over the past few years to understand the biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying drug resistance, with the goal to eventually overcome such daunting challenges. Diverse mechanisms, such as secondary mutations, oncogene bypass, and epigenetic alterations, can all lead to drug resistance, and the number of known involved genes is growing rapidly, thus providing many possibilities to overcome resistance. The finding of these mechanisms and genes invariably requires the application of genomic and functional genomic approaches to tumors or cancer models.

  abstract = {Background
Clinical responses to anti-cancer therapies often only benefit a defined subset of patients. Predicting the best treatment strategy hinges on our ability to effectively translate genomic data into actionable information on drug responses.

Results
To achieve this goal, we compiled a comprehensive collection of baseline cancer genome data and drug response information derived from a large panel of cancer cell lines. This data set was applied to identify the signature genes relevant to drug sensitivity and their resistance by integrating CNVs and the gene expression of cell lines with in vitro drug responses. We presented an efficient in-silico pipeline for integrating heterogeneous cell line data sources with the simultaneous modeling of drug response values across all the drugs and cell lines. Potential signature genes correlated with drug response (sensitive or resistant) in different cancer types were identified. Using signature genes, our collaborative filtering-based drug response prediction model outperformed the 44 algorithms submitted to the DREAM competition on breast cancer cells. The functions of the identified drug response related signature genes were carefully analyzed at the pathway level and the synthetic lethality level. Furthermore, we validated these signature genes by applying them to the classification of the different subtypes of the TCGA tumor samples, and further uncovered their in vivo implications using clinical patient data.

Conclusions
Our work may have promise in translating genomic data into customized marker genes relevant to the response of specific drugs for a specific cancer type of individual patients.},

  abstract = {Resistance to anticancer drugs is a complex process that results from alterations in drug targets; development of alternative pathways for growth activation; changes in cellular pharmacology, including increased drug efflux; regulatory changes that alter differentiation pathways or pathways for response to environmental adversity; and/or changes in the local physiology of the cancer, such as blood supply, tissue hydrodynamics, behavior of neighboring cells, and immune system response. All of these specific mechanisms are facilitated by the intrinsic hallmarks of cancer, such as tumor cell heterogeneity, redundancy of growth-promoting pathways, increased mutation rate and/or epigenetic alterations, and the dynamic variation of tumor behavior in time and space. Understanding the relative contribution of each of these factors is further complicated by the lack of adequate in vitro models that mimic clinical cancers. Several strategies to use current knowledge of drug resistance to improve treatment of cancer are suggested.},

  abstract = {Single-cell expression profiles of melanoma
Tumors harbor multiple cell types that are thought to play a role in the development of resistance to drug treatments. Tirosh et al. used single-cell sequencing to investigate the distribution of these differing genetic profiles within melanomas. Many cells harbored heterogeneous genetic programs that reflected two different states of genetic expression, one of which was linked to resistance development. Following drug treatment, the resistance-linked expression state was found at a much higher level. Furthermore, the environment of the melanoma cells affected their gene expression programs.
Science, this issue p. 189
To explore the distinct genotypic and phenotypic states of melanoma tumors, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to 4645 single cells isolated from 19 patients, profiling malignant, immune, stromal, and endothelial cells. Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients. Overall, we begin to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors and how single-cell genomics offers insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies.

We analyzed and compared the transcriptomes of 4043 cancer and 548 normal tissue samples from 21 TCGA cancer types, and created a comprehensive catalog of gene expression alterations for each cancer type. By clustering genes into co-regulated gene sets, we identified seven cross-cancer gene signatures altered across a diverse panel of primary human cancer samples. A 14-gene signature extracted from these seven cross-cancer gene signatures precisely differentiated between cancerous and normal samples, the predictive accuracy of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) were 92.04\%, 96.23\%, 91.76\%, 90.05\%, 88.17\%, 94.29\%, and 99.10\% for BLCA, BRCA, COAD, HNSC, LIHC, LUAD, and LUSC, respectively. A lung cancer-specific gene signature, containing SFTPA1 and SFTPA2 genes, accurately distinguished lung cancer from other cancer samples, the predictive accuracy of LOOCV for TCGA and GSE5364 data were 95.68\% and 100\%, respectively. These gene signatures provide rich insights into the transcriptional programs that trigger tumorigenesis and metastasis, and many genes in the signature gene panels may be of significant value to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.},

Replication tests show that these predictors capture, respectively, \textasciitilde{}40, 20, and 9 percent of total variance for the three traits. For example, predicted heights correlate \textasciitilde{}0.65 with actual height; actual heights of most individuals in validation samples are within a few cm of the prediction. The variance captured for height is comparable to the estimated SNP heritability from GCTA (GREML) analysis, and seems to be close to its asymptotic value (i.e., as sample size goes to infinity), suggesting that we have captured most of the heritability for the SNPs used. Thus, our results resolve the common SNP portion of the "missing heritability" problem - i.e., the gap between prediction R-squared and SNP heritability. The \textasciitilde{}20k activated SNPs in our height predictor reveal the genetic architecture of human height, at least for common SNPs. Our primary dataset is the UK Biobank cohort, comprised of almost 500k individual genotypes with multiple phenotypes.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypoxia is a major cause of radio- and chemoresistance. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is an endogenous hypoxia-related marker and an important prognostic marker. Assessment of CAIX expression may allow patient selection for hypoxia or CAIX-targeted treatment. The radioactive tracer 111In-girentuximab-F(ab')2 targets CAIX and can be used for SPECT imaging. Aim of this study was to validate and optimize 111In-girentuximab-F(ab')2 for imaging of CAIX expression in head and neck tumor xenografts.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Affinity and internalization kinetics of 111In-girentuximab-F(ab')2 were determined in vitro using CAIX-expressing SK-RC-52 cells. Tumor targeting characteristics were determined in athymic mice with six different head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCNij) xenografts. Tracer uptake was measured by ex vivo radioactivity counting. Intratumoral distribution of tracer uptake was measured using autoradiography and CAIX expression was determined immunohistochemically.
RESULTS: 26\% of the tracer was internalized into the SK-RC-52 cells within 24h. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 0.69$\pm$0.08nM. In biodistribution studies SCCNij153 tumors showed the highest tracer uptake: 4.1$\pm$0.8ID/g at 24h p.i. Immunohistochemical and autoradiographic analyses of the xenografts showed a distinct spatial correlation between localization of the tracer and CAIX expression.
CONCLUSION: 111In-girentuximab-F(ab')2 has a high affinity for CAIX. In vivo tumor uptake correlated strongly with CAIX expression in different head and neck xenografts. These results suggest that 111In-girentuximab-F(ab')2 is a promising tracer for imaging of hypoxia-related CAIX expression.},

The immunohistochemical staining (51 samples) and RT-PCR (33 samples) were performed to detect CA9 expression.Results: For immunohistochemistry detection, CA9 was positive in 31/34 of biopsy samples of ccRCCs. CA9 was also positive in five suspected diagnosis of ccRCC. For RT-PCR detection, CA9 was positive in 25/25 biopsy samples of ccRCCs. The diagnostic accuracy of CA9 expression for ccRCC was 100\%. RT-PCR was performed in four biopsies where immunohistochemistry could not be performed because of limited tissue materials or necrosis. Two ccRCCs with a negative staining by immunohistochemistry were CA9 positive by RT-PCR.Conclusions: CA9 may be potentially useful biomarker in help making a diagnosis of ccRCC in the biopsy of renal mass. RT-PCR might be a preferred method to immunohistochemistry for the detection of CA9 in renal biopsy samples.},

  abstract = {Tumor hypoxia is associated clinically with therapeutic resistance and poor patient outcomes. One feature of tumor hypoxia is activated expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), a regulator of pH and tumor growth. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that impeding the reuptake of bicarbonate produced extracellularly by CA9 could exacerbate the intracellular acidity produced by hypoxic conditions, perhaps compromising cell growth and viability as a result. In 8 of 10 cancer cell lines, we found that hypoxia induced the expression of at least one bicarbonate transporter. The most robust and frequent inductions were of the sodium-driven bicarbonate transporters SLC4A4 and SLC4A9, which rely upon both HIF1$\alpha$ and HIF2$\alpha$ activity for their expression. In cancer cell spheroids, SLC4A4 or SLC4A9 disruption by either genetic or pharmaceutical approaches acidified intracellular pH and reduced cell growth. Furthermore, treatment of spheroids with S0859, a small-molecule inhibitor of sodium-driven bicarbonate transporters, increased apoptosis in the cell lines tested. Finally, RNAi-mediated attenuation of SLC4A9 increased apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer spheroids and dramatically reduced growth of MDA-MB-231 breast tumors or U87 gliomas in murine xenografts. Our findings suggest that disrupting pH homeostasis by blocking bicarbonate import might broadly relieve the common resistance of hypoxic tumors to anticancer therapy.

  abstract = {Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is strongly induced by hypoxia and its overexpression is associated with poor therapeutic outcome in cancer. Here, we report that hypoxia promotes tumour heterogeneity through the epigenetic regulation of CAIX. Based on hypoxic CAIX expression we identify and characterize two distinct populations of tumour cells, one that has inducible expression of CAIX and one that does not. The CAIX+ve population is enriched with cells expressing cancer stem cell markers and which have high self-renewal capacity. We show that differential CAIX expression is due to differences in chromatin structure. To further investigate the relationship between chromatin organization and hypoxic induction of CAIX expression we investigated the effect of JQ1 an inhibitor of BET bromodomain proteins and A366 a selective inhibitor of the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a/GLP. We identified that these drugs were able to modulate hypoxic CAIX expression induction. This further highlights the role of epigenetic modification in adaption to hypoxia and also in regulation of heterogeneity of cells within tumours. Interestingly, we identified that the two subpopulations show a differential sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors, NaBu or SAHA, with the CAIX positive showing greater sensitivity to treatment. We propose that drugs modulating chromatin regulation of expression may be used to reduce heterogeneity induced by hypoxia and could in combination have significant clinical consequences.},

Biological changes after Ca9 transfection and after treatment with 5${'}$-azadeoxycytidine were also analysed in cancer cell lines., Results: Non-cancerous tissues strongly expressed Ca9 with membranous localisation. In contrast, Ca9 expression was frequently lost in gastric cancers (p$<$0.001). However, gastric cancers that retained Ca9 expression in cancer cells exhibited a shorter postoperative survival (p$\mkern1mu$=$\mkern1mu$0.028). In vitro analysis revealed that loss of Ca9 expression in gastric cancer cell lines was restored after treatment with 5${'}$-azadeoxycytidine and was associated with increased invasion (p$<$0.01). Moreover, AGS cells transfected with Ca9 exhibited significantly increased cell proliferation (p$<$0.05)., Conclusions: A subgroup of gastric cancers retain Ca9 expression in cancer cells at the invasion front. While loss of Ca9 expression is regulated in part by methylation, re-expression of Ca9 is associated with increased invasion, supporting the hypothesis that increased Ca9 expression may contribute to invasion and thus advanced disease and tumour progression in a subset of gastric cancers.},

This was a case-control study in which voided urine samples from 127 patients (63 control subjects and 64 patients with BCa) were analyzed. The urinary concentrations of VEGF, CA9, angiogenin, and bladder tumor antigen (BTA) were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We used the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves to determine the ability of VEGF, CA9, and angiogenin to detect BCa in voided urine samples. Data were also compared with the findings from a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based BCa detection assay (BTA-Trak). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. The urinary concentrations of VEGF, CA9, angiogenin, and BTA were significantly elevated in those with BCa. VEGF was the most accurate urinary biomarker (area under the curve 0.886, 95\% confidence interval 0.8301-0.9418). Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis highlighted VEGF (odds ratio 5.90, 95\% confidence interval 2.60-13.40, P $<$ .0001) as an independent variable. The sensitivity and specificity for VEGF (83\% sensitivity and 87\% specificity) outperformed those for BTA (80\% sensitivity and 84\% specificity). VEGF could be a valuable addition to voided urine sample analysis for the detection of BCa. Larger, prospective studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of urinary VEGF and angiogenin as biomarkers in the noninvasive evaluation of patients with BCa.},

  volume = {29},
  issn = {1570-5870},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypoxia modifies the phenotype of tumors in a way that promotes tumor aggressiveness and resistance towards chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the expression and influence of hypoxia-regulated proteins on tumor biology are not well characterized in colorectal tumors. We studied the role of protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) in patients with colorectal adenocarcinomas.
METHODS: Expression of HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, CA9 and GLUT1 was quantified by immunohistochemistry in 133 colorectal adenocarcinomas. The expression of hypoxia markers was correlated with clinicopathological variables and overall patient survival.
RESULTS: Expression of these hypoxia markers was detected in the epithelial compartment of the tumor cells as well as in tumor-associated stromal cells. Although tumor cells frequently showed expression of one or more of the investigated hypoxia markers, no correlation among these markers or with clinical response was found. However, within the tumor stroma, positive correlations between the hypoxia markers HIF-2alpha, CA9 and GLUT1 were observed. Furthermore expression of HIF-2alpha and CA9 in tumor-associated stroma were both associated with a significantly reduced overall survival. In the Cox proportional hazard model, stromal HIF-2alpha expression was an independent prognostic factor for survival.
CONCLUSION: These observations show, that expression of hypoxia regulated proteins in tumor-associated stromal cells, as opposed to their expression in epithelial tumor cells, is associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer. This study suggests that tumor hypoxia may influence tumor-associated stromal cells in a way that ultimately contributes to patient prognosis.},

Five-year overall survival is 15\%. Clinical trials frequently combine histologic types although they are different diseases with distinct origins. In the evolving era of personalized medicine and targeted therapies, we hypothesized that ESCC and EAC have genomic differences important for developing new therapeutic strategies for esophageal cancer. We explored DNA copy number abnormalities in 70 ESCCs with publicly available array data and 189 EACs from our group. All data was from single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Analysis was performed using a segmentation algorithm. Log ratio thresholds for copy number gain and loss were set at $\pm$0.2 (approximately 2.3 and 1.7 copies, respectively). The ESCC and EAC genomes showed some copy number abnormalities with similar frequencies (eg, CDKN2A, EGFR, KRAS, MYC, CDK6, MET) but also many copy number abnormalities with different frequencies between histologic types, most of which were amplification events. Some of these regions harbor genes for which targeted therapies are currently available (VEGFA, ERBB2) or for which agents are in clinical trials (PIK3CA, FGFR1). Other regions contain putative oncogenes that may be targeted in the future. Using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays we compared genomic abnormalities in a large cohort of EACs and ESCCs. We report here the similar and different frequencies of copy number abnormalities in ESCC and EAC. These results may allow development of histology-specific therapeutic agents for esophageal cancer.},

Molecular markers have the potential to characterize accurately the biological behavior of tumors and they may be useful for determining prognosis. A custom tissue array was constructed using clear cell RCC from 150 patients with metastatic RCC who underwent nephrectomy prior to immunotherapy. The tissue array was stained for 8 molecular markers, namely Ki67, p53, gelsolin, carbonic anhydrase (CA)9, CA12, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10), epithelial cell adhesion molecule and vimentin. Marker status and established clinical predictors of prognosis were considered when developing a prognostic model for disease specific survival. On univariate Cox regression analysis certain markers were statistically significant predictors of survival, namely CA9 (p $<$0.00001), p53 (p = 0.0072), gelsolin (p = 0.030), Ki67 (p = 0.036) and CA12 (p = 0.043).

The bias corrected concordance index (C-index) of this combined prognostic model was C = 0.68, which was significantly higher (p = 0.0033) than that of a multivariate clinical predictor model (C = 0.62) based on the UCLA Integrated Staging System (T category, histological grade and performance status).

This study examines the role of parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and perfusion computed tomography (CT) as surrogate markers of intratumoral hypoxia, defined by using the exogenous marker of hypoxia pimonidazole and the endogenous marker carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9). Patients with HNC underwent preoperative DCE-MRI, perfusion CT, and pimonidazole infusion. Imaging parameters were correlated with pimonidazole and CA9 staining. The strength of correlations was tested by using a two-tailed Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Twenty-three regions of interest were analyzed from the 7 patients who completed the DCE-MRI studies. A number of statistically significant correlations were seen between DCE-MRI parameters (volume transfer between blood plasma and extracellular extravascular space [EES], volume of EES, rate constant between EES and blood plasma, time at arrival of contrast inflow, time to peak, average gradient, and time to onset) and areas with a pimonidazole score of 4. In the case of CA9 staining, only a weak correlation was shown with wash-in rate. There were no significant correlations between perfusion CT parameters and pimonidazole staining or CA9 expression. Intratumoral hypoxia in patients with HNC may be predicted by using DCE-MRI; however, perfusion CT requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {Pediatric sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors of bone and soft tissue origin. Although more than 100 different histologic subtypes have been described, the majority of pediatric cases belong to the Ewing's family of tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma. Most patients that present with localized stage are curable with surgery and/or chemotherapy; however, those with metastatic disease at diagnosis or those who experience a relapse continue to have a very poor prognosis. New therapies for these patients are urgently needed. Immunotherapy is an established treatment modality for both liquid and solid tumors, and in pediatrics, most notably for neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. In the past, immunomodulatory agents such as interferon, interleukin-2, and liposomal-muramyl tripeptide phosphatidyl-ethanolamine have been tried, with some activity seen in subsets of patients; additionally, various cancer vaccines have been studied with possible benefit. Monoclonal antibody therapies against tumor antigens such as disialoganglioside GD2 or immune checkpoint targets such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 are being actively explored in pediatric sarcomas. Building on the success of adoptive T cell therapy for EBV-related lymphoma, strategies to redirect T cells using chimeric antigen receptors and bispecific antibodies are rapidly evolving with potential for the treatment of sarcomas. This review will focus on recent preclinical and clinical developments in targeted agents for pediatric sarcomas with emphasis on the immunobiology of immune checkpoints, immunoediting, tumor microenvironment, antibody engineering, cell engineering, and tumor vaccines. The future integration of antibody-based and cell-based therapies into an overall treatment strategy of sarcoma will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been recently suggested to contribute to tumorigenesis by an autocrine mechanism in fibroblast cells overexpressing its receptor, the MET/HGFR protein. Since epithelial cells represent the primary physiologic target of HGF, we investigated whether inappropriate expression of HGF by epithelial cells which normally express MET/HGFR may also contribute to tumorigenesis. We have transfected a full length rat HGF gene into three mouse epithelial cell lines, one derived from breast (MM55) and two (BNL CL.2 and NMuLi) representing liver non-parenchymal epithelial cells (NPEC). We confirmed the presence of the transfected gene by Southern blot analysis, the production of HGF protein by immunofluorescence, and the preservation of HGF biologic activity by bio-assay. In comparison to untransfected cells, all three HGF-transfected cell lines displayed high level MET/HGFR autophosphorylation and increased ability to proliferate in media containing low serum. The two HGF-transfected liver NPEC lines, but not the HGF-transfected mammary cell line, displayed loss of cell contact growth-inhibition and acquired a markedly increased ability to form colonies in soft agar. Furthermore, the NPEC HGF-transfected cell lines formed much larger tumors in nude mice than the untransfected counterparts, with extensive invasion and sporadic lung metastases. These results demonstrate that overexpression of HGF in at least some epithelial cells contribute to tumorigenesis, and furthermore suggest a possible role for the HGF-MET/HGFR system in the progression of certain epithelial tumors.},

  abstract = {Purpose Cabozantinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and rearranged during transfection (RET), demonstrated clinical activity in patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in phase I.   Patients and Methods We conducted a double-blind, phase III trial comparing cabozantinib with placebo in 330 patients with documented radiographic progression of metastatic MTC. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to cabozantinib (140 mg per day) or placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Additional outcome measures included tumor response rate, overall survival, and safety.   Results The estimated median PFS was 11.2 months for cabozantinib versus 4.0 months for placebo (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95\% CI, 0.19 to 0.40; P $<$ .001). Prolonged PFS with cabozantinib was observed across all subgroups including by age, prior TKI treatment, and RET mutation status (hereditary or sporadic). Response rate was 28\% for cabozantinib and 0\% for placebo; responses were seen regardless of RET mutation status. Kaplan-Meier estimates of patients alive and progression-free at 1 year are 47.3\% for cabozantinib and 7.2\% for placebo. Common cabozantinib-associated adverse events included diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, decreased weight and appetite, nausea, and fatigue and resulted in dose reductions in 79\% and holds in 65\% of patients. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 16\% of cabozantinib-treated patients and in 8\% of placebo-treated patients.   Conclusion Cabozantinib (140 mg per day) achieved a statistically significant improvement of PFS in patients with progressive metastatic MTC and represents an important new treatment option for patients with this rare disease. This dose of cabozantinib was associated with significant but manageable toxicity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:

The authors systematically reviewed the literature and conducted a pooled analysis of studies on small renal masses who underwent active surveillance to identify the risk progression and the characteristics associated with metastases.

METHODS:

A search of the MEDLINE database was performed to identify all clinical series that reported the surveillance of localized renal masses. For studies that reported individual-level data, clinical and radiographic characteristics of tumors without progression were compared with the characteristics of tumors that progressed to metastases.

RESULTS:

Eighteen series (880 patients, 936 masses) met screening criteria; and, among these, 18 patients were identified who had tumors that progressed to metastasis (mean, 40.2 months). Six studies (259 patients, 284 masses) provided individual-level data for pooled analysis. At a mean ($\pm$standard deviation) follow-up of 33.5 $\pm$ 22.6 months, the mean initial greatest tumor dimension was 2.3 $\pm$ 1.3 cm, and mean linear growth rate was 0.31 $\pm$ 0.38 cm per year. Sixty-five masses (23\%) exhibited zero net growth under surveillance, and none of those masses progressed to metastasis. A pooled analysis revealed increased age (age 75.1 $\pm$ 9.1 years vs 66.6 $\pm$ 12.3 years; P = .03), an initial greatest tumor dimension (4.1 $\pm$ 2.1 cm vs 2.3 $\pm$ 1.3 cm; P $<$ .0001), initial estimated tumor volume (66.3 $\pm$ 100.0 cm3 vs 15.1 $\pm$ 60.3 cm3; p = .0001), linear growth rate of (0.8 $\pm$ 0.65 cm per year vs 0.3 $\pm$ 0.4 cm per year; P = .0001), and a volumetric growth rate of 27.1 $\pm$ 24.9 cm3 per year (vs 6.2 $\pm$ 27.5 cm3 per year; P $<$ .0001) in the progression cohort.

CONCLUSIONS:

A substantial proportion of small renal masses remained radiographically static after an initial period of active surveillance. Progression to metastases occurred in a small percentage of patients and generally was a late event. The current results indicated that, in patients who have competing health risks, radiographic surveillance may be an acceptable initial approach, and delayed intervention may be reserved for patients who have tumors that exhibit significant linear or volumetric growth.

  abstract = {Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a biologically heterogeneous disease, with many small renal masses (SRMs) exhibiting an indolent natural history, while others progress more rapidly to become life-threatening. Existing multiphase contrast-enhanced imaging methods, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, cannot definitively distinguish between benign and malignant solid tumors or identify histologic subtype, and early results of molecular imaging studies (positron emission tomography [PET]) in the evaluation of SRMs have not improved on these established modalities. Alternative molecular markers/agents recognizing aberrant cellular pathways of cellular oxidative metabolism, DNA synthesis, and tumor hypoxia tracers are currently under development and investigation for RCC assessment, but to date none are yet clinically applicable or available. In contrast, immuno-PET offers highly selective binding to cancer-specific antigens, and might identify radiographically recognizable and distinct molecular targets. A phase I proof-of-concept study first demonstrated the ability of immuno-PET to discriminate between clear-cell RCC (ccRCC) and non-ccRCC, utilizing a chimeric monoclonal antibody to carbonic anhydrase IX (cG250, girentuximab) labeled with 124I (124I-girentuximab PET); the study examined patients with renal masses who subsequently underwent standard surgical resection. A follow-up phase III multicenter trial confirmed that 124I-cG250-PET can accurately and noninvasively identify ccRCC with high sensitivity (86\%), specificity (87\%), and positive predictive value (95\%). In the challenge to appropriately match treatment of an incidentally identified SRM to its biological potential, this highly accurate and histologically specific molecular imaging modality demonstrates the ability of imaging to provide clinically important preoperative diagnostic information, which can result in optimal and personalized therapy.},

  abstract = {Background
Patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have a dismal prognosis. Therefore, new and less toxic treatments are needed.
Objective
We determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and potential therapeutic efficacy of multiple infusions of lutetium 177 (177Lu)-girentuximab (cG250) on various dose levels in a phase 1 trial in patients with progressive metastasized ccRCC.
Design, setting, and participants
In this uncontrolled case series in 23 patients with progressive ccRCC metastases, cG250 accumulation was verified by diagnostic indium 111-cG250 imaging. Patients then received a high-activity dose of 177Lu-cG250.
Intervention
Groups of three patients received 177Lu-cG250, starting at a dose level of 1110 MBq/m2 177Lu-cG250, with dose increments of 370 MBq/m2 per group. In the absence of persistent toxicity, progressive disease, and accelerated blood clearance, patients were eligible for retreatment after 3 mo with 75\% of the previous activity dose. Patients could receive a total of three treatment cycles.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis
Determination of the MTD was the primary and therapeutic efficacy was the secondary outcome measurement of the study.
Results and limitations
The MTD was 2405 MBq/m2 because higher doses resulted in dose-limiting myelotoxicity. Some patients received second (13 of 23 [56\%]) and third (4 of 23 [17\%]) treatment cycles. Most patients (17 of 23 [74\%]) demonstrated stable disease 3 mo after the first treatment, and one patient showed a partial response that lasted for 9 mo. Mean growth of target tumor lesions was reduced from 40.4\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], $\pm$17.0) during the last 3 mo before study entry to 5.5\% (95\% CI, $\pm$5.3; p$<$0.001) at 3 mo after the first treatment cycle. No major nonhematologic side effects were observed.
Conclusions
177Lu-cG250 radioimmunotherapy in metastatic ccRCC patients is well tolerated at an activity dose level as high as 2405 MBq/m2 (MTD). Radioimmunotherapy with 177Lu-cG250 may stabilize previously progressive metastatic ccRCC.},

  abstract = {Background
Improved and more frequent radiologic evaluation has resulted in increased identification of renal masses of unknown origin, which frequently pose a diagnostic dilemma for urologists.
Objective
Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is an antigen ubiquitously expressed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The specific and high level of expression in ccRCC makes CAIX an excellent target for imaging ccRCC lesions. We present our experience with immuno\textendash{}single-photon emission computed tomography (immunoSPECT) imaging with the indium-111 (111In)\textendash{}labeled anti-CAIX antibody girentuximab in patients presenting with either a primary renal tumor or a history of ccRCC and lesions suspect for metastases during follow-up.
Design, setting, and participants
Twenty-nine patients received 100\textendash{}200 MBq 111In-labeled girentuximab. Whole-body and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were acquired after 4\textendash{}7 d.
Intervention
Injection with 111In-girentuximab and image acquisition after 4\textendash{}7 d.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis
Accuracy of 111In-girentuximab immunoSPECT.
Results and limitations
Distinct uptake of 111In-girentuximab was seen in 16 of 22 patients presenting with a renal mass. All renal masses proven to be ccRCC after resection (n=15) were detected with 111In-girentuximab. Suspect lesions of six patients showed no uptake of 111In-girentuximab. In these patients, ccRCC was not found, nor progression occurred. Seven patients with a history of ccRCC and possible metastatic lesions on follow-up computed tomography scans were imaged with 111In-girentuximab. In four of these patients, the lesions showed preferential uptake of 111In-girentuximab and local or systemic treatment was initiated. In three other cases, no 111In-girentuximab targeting was seen. During follow-up of these three patients, one showed progression, for which systemic treatment was started. In the two other patients, no progression occurred, suggesting a benign nature.
Conclusions
111In-girentuximab immunoSPECT can be used to detect ccRCC lesions in patients with a primary renal mass and to clarify the nature of lesions suspect for metastases in patients with a history of ccRCC.},

Girentuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds carbonic anhydrase IX, a cell surface glycoprotein ubiquitously expressed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Its safety and activity in phase 2 studies prompted investigation into its use as adjuvant monotherapy in participants with high-risk ccRCC.$<$/p$>$

\subsubsection{Objective$<$/h3$>$

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjuvant girentuximab on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with localized completely resected high-risk ccRCC.$<$/p$>$

\subsubsection{Design, Setting, and Participants$<$/h3$>$

The ARISER trial (Adjuvant Rencarex Immunotherapy Phase 3 Trial to Study Efficacy in Nonmetastatic RCC) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial that took place between June 10, 2004, and April 2, 2013, at 142 academic medical centers in 15 countries in North and South America and Europe. Eligible adult patients had undergone partial or radical nephrectomy for histologically confirmed ccRCC and fell into 1 of the following high-risk groups: pT3/pT4Nx/N0M0 or pTanyN+M0 or pT1b/pT2Nx/N0M0 with nuclear grade 3 or greater. Patients were assigned via central computerized double-blind 1:1 randomization to receive either a single loading dose of girentuximab, 50 mg (week 1), followed by weekly intravenous infusions of girentuximab, 20 mg (weeks 2-24), or placebo, stratified by risk group and region. The data were analyzed from March 31, 2012, to April 2, 2013.$<$/p$>$

\subsubsection{Main Outcomes and Measures$<$/h3$>$

Co\textendash{}primary end points were DFS and OS, based on imaging studies assessed by independent radiological review committee. Secondary end points included safety, assessed as the rate and grade of adverse events.$<$/p$>$

\subsubsection{Results$<$/h3$>$

A total of 864 patients (66\% male; median [interquartile range] age, 58 [51-65] years) were randomized to girentuximab (n = 433) or placebo (n = 431). Compared with placebo, participants treated with girentuximab had no statistically significant DFS (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.79-1.18) or OS advantage (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95\% CI, 0.74-1.32). Median DFS was 71.4 months (interquartile range, 3 months to not reached) for girentuximab and never reached for placebo group. Median OS was never reached regardless of treatment. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 185 patients (21.6\%), reported comparably between arms. Serious adverse events occurred in 72 patients (8.4\%), reported comparably between arms. One drug-related serious adverse event occurred in a patient receiving placebo.$<$/p$>$

\subsubsection{Conclusions and Relevance$<$/h3$>$

Girentuximab had no clinical benefit as adjuvant treatment for patients with high-risk ccRCC. The surprisingly long DFS and OS in these patients represent a challenge to adjuvant ccRCC drug development.$<$/p$>$

  abstract = {Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Although TKIs have demonstrated good clinical efficacy, the lack of complete responses, the chronic nature of the treatment, and the side effects are clear disadvantages. An interesting new approach in the treatment of clear cell RCC is antibody-mediated therapy with the chimeric anti\textendash{}carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) antibody girentuximab (cG250). As the results of several girentuximab trials become available, the question arises of whether TKI treatment can be combined with girentuximab-based therapy. In this study, we assessed the effect of the widely used TKI sorafenib on the tumor-targeting potential of 111In-labeled girentuximab. Methods: 111In-girentuximab imaging was performed on 15 patients suspected of having a renal malignancy, with surgery being part of their treatment plan. Of these, 10 patients were treated in a neoadjuvant setting with sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily). Five patients received treatment during 1 wk, and 5 patients received treatment during 4 wk. In both sorafenib-treated groups, baseline and posttreatment tumor targeting of 111In-girentuximab were compared. Surgery was performed 3 d after the last image acquisition. Five additional patients were included as a control group and had only a single 111In-girentuximab injection and scintigraphy without any treatment. Distribution of 111In-girentuximab was determined scintigraphically ex vivo in a 1-cm lamella of the resected tumorous kidney. Expression of CAIX and of the vascular marker CD31 was determined immunohistochemically on specimens of both tumor and normal kidney tissue. Results: Treatment with sorafenib resulted in a marked decrease of 111In-girentuximab uptake in the tumor in clear cell RCC patients, especially in the group treated for 4 wk (mean change in both sorafenib-treated groups, -38.4\%; range, +9.1\% to -79.4\%). Immunohistochemical analysis showed markedly reduced CD31 expression and vessel density in the sorafenib-treated groups but no differences in CAIX expression between the sorafenib-treated groups and the nontreated patients. Conclusion: Treatment with sorafenib resulted in a treatment duration\textendash{}dependent significantly decreased uptake of 111In-girentumab in clear cell RCC lesions. These results indicate that the efficacy of antibody-mediated treatment or diagnosis modalities is hampered by TKI treatment.},

  abstract = {Near-infrared dye-tagged antibodies can be used for the sensitive detection of tumor tissue in vivo. Surgery for clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) might benefit from the use of optical imaging to facilitate the intraoperative detection of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)\textendash{}expressing tumor lesions with chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) girentuximab, which has been shown to have excellent imaging capabilities for ccRCC. Here we studied the potential of fluorescence imaging to detect ccRCC tumors in nude mice with RCC xenografts by using mAb girentuximab conjugated with IRDye800CW; SPECT imaging was used as a reference. Methods: Groups of athymic BALB/c mice with subcutaneous CAIX-positive SK-RC-52 ccRCC tumors were injected intravenously with 125I-labeled girentuximab-IRDye800CW or 125I-labeled girentuximab. For determination of the specificity of the accumulation of the anti-CAIX antibody conjugate in ccRCC, separate groups of mice bearing a CAIX-positive tumor (SK-RC-52) and a CAIX-negative tumor (SK-RC-59) received 125I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW or 125I-labeled MOPC21-IRDye800CW (control mAb). Optical images and micro-SPECT images were acquired until 3 d after injection. Mice were euthanized after the last imaging session, and the biodistribution of the radiolabeled antibody preparations was determined. Results: Optical imaging and micro-SPECT imaging at 1 d after the injection of 125I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW showed clear delineation of the CAIX-expressing ccRCC xenografts, and image contrast improved with time. Fluorescence imaging and biodistribution studies showed high and specific uptake of 125I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW in CAIX-positive ccRCC xenografts (SK-RC-52, 31.5 $\pm$ 9.6 percentage injected dose per gram [\%ID/g] at 72 h after injection). Tumor uptake was specific, as very low uptake of 125I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW was noted in the CAIX-negative SK-RC-59 tumor (4.1 $\pm$ 1.5 \%ID/g), and no uptake of 125I-MOPC21-IRDye800CW (control mAb) was noted in the CAIX-positive SK-RC-52 tumor (1.2 $\pm$ 0.1 \%ID/g). Conclusion: Subcutaneous CAIX-expressing ccRCC xenografts were visualized by optical imaging with 125I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW. Optical images showed good concordance with micro-SPECT images. The accumulation of 125I-girentuximab-IRDye800CW in ccRCC tumors was high and specific. Girentuximab-IRDye800CW potentially could be used for the intraoperative detection of CAIX-expressing tumors and the assessment of residual tumor in resection margins or metastatic lesions in patients with ccRCC.},

A phase 2 radioimmunotherapy (RIT) trial with lutetium 177 (177Lu)\textendash{}girentuximab was initiated to evaluate the efficacy of this approach. In this nonrandomized single-arm trial, patients with progressive metastatic ccRCC who met the inclusion criteria received 2405 MBq/m2 of 177Lu-girentuximab intravenously. In the absence of persistent toxicity and progressive disease, patients were eligible for retreatment after 3 mo with 75\% of the previous activity dose. A total of 14 patients were included. After the first therapeutic infusion, eight patients (57\%) had stable disease (SD) and one (7\%) had a partial regression. The treatment was generally well tolerated but resulted in grade 3\textendash{}4 myelotoxicity in most patients. After the second cycle, continued SD was observed in five of six patients, but none were eligible for retreatment due to prolonged thrombocytopenia.

  abstract = {Background and purpose
Hypoxia is a major cause of radio- and chemoresistance. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is an endogenous hypoxia-related marker and an important prognostic marker. Assessment of CAIX expression may allow patient selection for hypoxia or CAIX-targeted treatment. The radioactive tracer 111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 targets CAIX and can be used for SPECT imaging. Aim of this study was to validate and optimize 111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 for imaging of CAIX expression in head and neck tumor xenografts.
Material and methods
Affinity and internalization kinetics of 111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 were determined in vitro using CAIX-expressing SK-RC-52 cells. Tumor targeting characteristics were determined in athymic mice with six different head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCNij) xenografts. Tracer uptake was measured by ex vivo radioactivity counting. Intratumoral distribution of tracer uptake was measured using autoradiography and CAIX expression was determined immunohistochemically.
Results
26\% of the tracer was internalized into the SK-RC-52 cells within 24\hspace{0.25em}h. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 0.69\hspace{0.25em}$\pm$\hspace{0.25em}0.08\hspace{0.25em}nM. In biodistribution studies SCCNij153 tumors showed the highest tracer uptake: 4.1\hspace{0.25em}$\pm$\hspace{0.25em}0.8\hspace{0.25em}ID/g at 24\hspace{0.25em}h p.i. Immunohistochemical and autoradiographic analyses of the xenografts showed a distinct spatial correlation between localization of the tracer and CAIX expression.
Conclusion
111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 has a high affinity for CAIX. In vivo tumor uptake correlated strongly with CAIX expression in different head and neck xenografts. These results suggest that 111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 is a promising tracer for imaging of hypoxia-related CAIX expression.},

  abstract = {The transcriptional complex hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) has emerged as an important mediator of gene expression patterns in tumors, although the range of responding genes is still incompletely defined. Here we show that the tumor-associated carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are tightly regulated by this system. Both CA9 and CA12 were strongly induced by hypoxia in a range of tumor cell lines. In renal carcinoma cells that are defective for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor, up-regulation of these CAs is associated with loss of regulation by hypoxia, consistent with the critical function of pVHL in the regulation of HIF-1. Further studies of CA9 defined a HIF-1-dependent hypoxia response element in the minimal promoter and demonstrated that tight regulation by the HIF/pVHL system was reflected in the pattern of CA IX expression within tumors. Generalized up-regulation of CA IX in VHL-associated renal cell carcinoma contrasted with focal perinecrotic expression in a variety of non-VHL-associated tumors. In comparison with vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA, expression of CA IX demonstrated a similar, although more tightly circumscribed, pattern of expression around regions of necrosis and showed substantial although incomplete overlap with activation of the hypoxia marker pimonidazole. These studies define a new class of HIF-1-responsive gene, the activation of which has implications for the understanding of hypoxic tumor metabolism and which may provide endogenous markers for tumor hypoxia.},

  abstract = {Non\textendash{}small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a difficult disease to treat. The c-Met receptor is an attractive potential target for novel therapeutic inhibition in human cancers. We provide strong evidence that c-Met is overexpressed, activated, and sometimes mutated in NSCLC cell lines and tumor tissues. Expression of c-Met was found in all (100\%) of the NSCLC tumor tissues examined (n = 23) and most (89\%) of the cell lines (n = 9). Sixty-one percent of tumor tissues strongly expressed total c-Met, especially adenocarcinoma (67\%). Specific expression of phospho-Met (p-Met) [Y1003] and [Y1230/1234/1235] was seen by immunohistochemistry. p-Met expression was preferentially observed at the NSCLC tumor invasive fronts. c-Met alterations were identified within the semaphorin domain (E168D, L299F, S323G, and N375S) and the juxtamembrane domain (R988C, R988C + T1010I, S1058P, and alternative splice product skipping entire juxtamembrane domain) of a NSCLC cell line and adenocarcinoma tissues. We validated c-Met as potential therapeutic target using small interfering RNA down-regulation of the receptor expression by 50\% to 60\% in NSCLC cells. This led to inhibition of p-Met and phospho-AKT and up to 57.1 $\pm$ 7.2\% cell viability inhibition at 72 hours. The selective small molecule inhibitor of c-Met SU11274 inhibited cell viability in c-Met-expressing NSCLC cells. SU11274 also abrogated hepatocyte growth factor\textendash{}induced phosphorylation of c-Met and its downstream signaling. Here, we provide first direct evidence by small interfering RNA targeting and small molecule inhibitor that c-Met is important in NSCLC biology and biochemistry. These results indicate that c-Met inhibition will be an important therapeutic strategy against NSCLC to improve its clinical outcome.},

These pleiotropic actions are fundamentally important during development, homeostasis, and tissue regeneration. HGF signaling also contributes to oncogenesis and tumor progression in several human cancers and promotes aggressive cellular invasiveness that is strongly linked to tumor metastasis. Our present understanding of c-Met oncogenic signaling supports at least three avenues of pathway selective anticancer drug development: antagonism of ligand/receptor interaction, inhibition of TK catalytic activity, and blockade of intracellular receptor/effector interactions. Potent and selective preclinical drug candidates have been developed using all three strategies, and human clinical trials in two of the three areas are now under way.},

  abstract = {8001  Background:  c-Met-amplified NSCLC defines a subset of NSCLC that may be sensitive to the small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib, approved multinationally for the treatment of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. Efficacy and safety data are presented for crizotinib in patients with advanced c-Met-amplified NSCLC within 3 categories of amplification MET/CEP7 ratio $\geq$1.8-$\leq$2.2 (Low), $>$2.2-$<$5 (Intermediate) and $\geq$5 (High).  Methods:  c-METamplification status was determined by FISH, with 10-12 patients to be enrolled into each amplification category.  If 2 or more objective responses occur in a category, 19 additional patients are to be enrolled.  This study is part of an ongoing phase 1 crizotinib study (NCT00585195).  Patients received crizotinib 250 mg BID. Responses were assessed using RECIST v1.0.  Results:  At data cut-off, 16 patients were enrolled; 3 were subsequently determined not to have an amplification meeting MET/CEP7 criteria.  13 patients with c-MET-amplifiedNSCLC [Low (n=1), Intermediate (n=6) and High (n=6)] enrolled and received crizotinib, with 12 evaluable for response. Median age was 63 years (range 42-79), 92\% of patients were ECOG 0 or 1 and  77\% were ex-smokers. To date 4 PRs (33\%; 95\% CI: 10,65) have been observed (Low (n=0), Intermediate (n=1; 20\%) and High (3; 50\%).  Median duration of response was 35 weeks [95\% CI: 16,112]. Median treatment duration was 15.7 weeks (range 4 -188), and 6 patients were on treatment at the data cut-off; 5 patients have died (all disease-related). 75\% of the 16 patients enrolled had treatment-related adverse events (AEs): most commonly diarrhea (50\%), nausea (31\%), vomiting (31\%), peripheral edema (n=25\%) and visual impairment (25\%). Most AEs were grade 1 in severity. There were no treatment-related serious AEs or treatment-related permanent discontinuations. Accrual of patients with c-Met-amplified NSCLC is ongoing.  Conclusions:  Crizotinib appears to have antitumor activity in patients with c-Met-amplified NSCLC and a generally tolerable and manageable AE profile. These findings warrant further study of crizotinib in advanced c-MET-amplified NSCLC and ongoing exploration of the MET/CEP7 ratio associated with clinical benefit.

Notably, activating mutations in c-Met have been positively identified in patients with a particular hereditary form of papillary renal cancer, directly implicating c-Met in human tumorigenesis. Aberrant signaling of the c-Met signaling pathway due to dysregulation of the c-Met receptor or overexpression of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), has been associated with an aggressive phenotype. Extensive evidence that c-Met signaling is involved in the progression and spread of several cancers and an enhanced understanding of its role in disease have generated considerable interest in c-Met and HGF as major targets in cancer drug development. This has led to the development of a variety of c-Met pathway antagonists with potential clinical applications. The three main approaches of pathway-selective anticancer drug development have included antagonism of ligand/receptor interaction, inhibition of the tyrosine kinase catalytic activity, and blockade of the receptor/effector interaction. Several c-Met antagonists are now under clinical investigation. Preliminary clinical results of several of these agents, including both monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have been encouraging. Several multitargeted therapies have also been under investigation in the clinic and have demonstrated promise, particularly with regard to tyrosine kinase inhibition.},

The role of c-Met/HGF axis in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has not been reported previously. We have determined the expression of p170c-Met precursor and p140c-Met $\beta$-chain in seven SCLC cell lines by immunoblotting. We used the SCLC cell line H69, which expressed an abundant amount of c-Met to study the function and downstream effects of c-Met activation. Stimulation of H69 cells with HGF (40 ng/ml, 6-h stimulation) significantly altered cell motility of the SCLC cells with increased formation of filopodia and membrane ruffling, characterized as membrane blebbing, as well as increased migration of the cellular clusters were seen. We have further studied the signal transduction pathways of HGF/c-Met in the H69 cell line. The stimulation of H69 with HGF (40 ng/ml, $>$24 h, maximal at 1 h) increased the amount of reactive oxygen species formed by 34\%. HGF stimulation (40 ng/ml, 7.5-min stimulation) of H69 cells showed increased tyrosine phosphorylated bands identified at Mr 68,000, 120,000\textendash{}140,000, and 200,000. Some of these tyrosine-phosphorylated bands were identified as the focal adhesion proteins paxillin, FAK, PYK2, and the c-Met receptor itself. Phospho-specific antibodies show that tyrosines at amino acid (a.a.) 31 of paxillin, and autophosphorylation sites at a.a. 397 of p125FAK, and a.a. 402 of PYK2 are phosphorylated in response to HGF/c-Met signaling. We also demonstrate that the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, which also affects c-Met, reduced the growth and viability of four of four SCLC cell lines by 25\% to 85\%, over a 72-h time period. Geldanamycin caused apoptosis of SCLC cells, as well as led to increased levels of Hsp70 but not Hsp90. These results demonstrate that c-Met/HGF pathway is functional in SCLC, and it would be useful to target this pathway toward novel therapy.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Both c-MET and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C expression are important factors in primary carcinoma progression. We hypothesized that overexpression of c-MET and/or VEGF-C mRNA in primary colorectal cancer (CRC) can predict tumor invasion and regional metastasis.
Experimental Design: The level of c-MET and VEGF-C mRNA expression was assessed using a quantitative RT-RealTime PCR assay on early stage primary CRC tumors (n = 36).
Results: The c-MET mRNA copy number ranged from 1.18 \texttimes{} 102 to 1.11 \texttimes{} 106 copies (median 5.17 \texttimes{} 104) per 250 ng of RNA from CRC specimens. c-MET mRNA copies in CRC specimens was significantly higher than that from normal colon mucosal epithelium (P = 0.0001). c-MET mRNA copies significantly correlated with the depth of invasion: T1 versus T2, P = 0.007; T1 versus T3/T4, P = 0.0001; T1 versus T2 versus T3/T4, P = 0.0005; and T1/T2 versus T3/T4, P = 0.011. c-MET copy number in primary CRC of N1/N2 staged patients was significantly higher than N0 cases (P $<$ 0.03). Expression levels of c-MET mRNA were verified with immunohistochemistry analysis of c-MET protein expression in CRC specimens and normal mucosal epithelium. The VEGF-C mRNA copies of primary CRC assessed ranged from 0 to 1.65 \texttimes{} 105 copies (median 580). Although VEGF-C mRNA copies in CRC primary tumors were significantly higher than normal colon mucosal epithelium (P = 0.0008), it did not correlate with any major clinicopathological parameters of CRC.
Conclusions: This study indicates c-MET mRNA overexpression in primary CRC may be an important prognostic marker for early stage invasion and regional disease metastasis.},

The growth and motility factor hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and its receptor tyrosine kinase MET, the product of the \emph{MET} proto-oncogene, provide essential signals for survival and long-distance migration of epithelial and myogenic precursor cells during embryogenesis. Cancer cells hijack HGF/SF\textendash{}MET for invasion and metastasis, hence these molecules have emerged as key targets for cancer therapy.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$
                    
\item 

Aberrant MET activation occurs in many types of cancer, and results from multiple mechanisms. Many carcinomas overexpress MET and the surrounding stroma overexpresses HGF/SF. Furthermore, certain patients with renal papillary, hepatocellular or gastric carcinomas carry point mutations in \emph{MET}. These mutations have proved important in demonstrating a causal role of aberrant MET signalling in human cancer.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$
                    
\item 

The intracellular signalling cascades activated by MET include the PI3K\textendash{}AKT, RAC1\textendash{}cell division control protein 42 (CDC42), RAP1 and RAS\textendash{}MAPK pathways. An intricate network of cross-signalling involving the MET\textendash{}epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), MET\textendash{}vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and MET\textendash{}WNT pathways has also emerged in the past few years. This signalling network has major implications for therapy.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$
                    
\item 

Structural studies of HGF/SF, the MET ectodomain and the pathways involved in activation of the precursor form of HGF/SF (pro-HGF/SF) have yielded important results and new opportunities for therapeutic intervention, namely specific inhibitors of the major HGF/SF activators, HGF/SF fragments with antagonistic activity \textemdash{} such as NK4 \textemdash{} and HGF/SF and MET antibodies.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$
                    
\item 

Parallel efforts in the structural analysis of the MET kinase have led to extensive progress in the development of MET kinase inhibitors for cancer therapy, and three major classes of inhibitors have emerged from this work that differ in their binding mode, activity on MET kinase mutants and enzyme specificity.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$
                    
\item 

A number of recent clinical trials have demonstrated strong activity of MET inhibitors in patients with a variety of advanced or metastatic tumours, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and breast, prostate, liver and renal cancer. MET inhibitors have also displayed clinical benefits in patients with NSCLC and patients with breast cancer who had developed resistance to EGFR therapy. These recent data clearly indicate that HGF/SF\textendash{}MET therapeutics may have potential in several groups of cancer patients either alone or in combination with inhibitors of other signalling pathways.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

  abstract = {Studies on signal transduction pathways have generated various promising molecular targets for therapeutic inhibition in cancer therapy. Receptor tyrosine kinases represent an important class of such therapeutic targets. c-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase that has been shown to be overexpressed and/or mutated in a variety of malignancies. A number of c-Met activating mutations, many of which are located in the tyrosine kinase domain, have been detected in various solid tumors and have been implicated in invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. It is known that stimulation of c-Met via its natural ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (also known as scatter factor, HGF/SF) results in a plethora of biological and biochemical effects in the cell. Activation of c-Met signaling can lead to scattering, angiogenesis, proliferation, enhanced cell motility, invasion, and eventual metastasis. In this review, the role of c-Met dysregulation in tumor progression and metastasis is discussed in detail with particular emphasis on c-Met mutations. Moreover, we summarize current knowledge on various pathways of c-Met signal transduction, highlighting the central role in the cytoskeletal functions. In this summary is included recent data in our laboratory indicating that phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins, such as paxillin, p125FAK, and PYK2, occurs in response to c-Met stimulation in lung cancer cells.

  abstract = {c-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase that upon binding of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), activates downstream pathways with diverse cellular functions that are important in organ development and cancer progression. Anomalous c-Met signalling has been described in a variety of cancer types, and the receptor is regarded as a novel therapeutic target. In breast cancer there is a need to develop new treatments, particularly for the aggressive subtypes such as triple-negative and basal-like cancer, which currently lack targeted therapy. Over the last two decades, much has been learnt about the functional role of c-Met signalling in different models of breast development and cancer. This work has been complemented by clinical studies, establishing the prognostic significance of c-Met in tissue samples of breast cancer. While the clinical trials of anti-c-Met therapy in advanced breast cancer progress, there is a need to review the existing evidence so that the potential of these treatments can be better appreciated. The aim of this article is to examine the role of HGF/c-Met signalling in in vitro and in vivo models of breast cancer, to describe the mechanisms of aberrant c-Met signalling in human tissues, and to give a brief overview of the anti-c-Met therapies currently being evaluated in breast cancer patients. We will show that the HGF/c-Met pathway is associated with breast cancer progression and suggest that there is a firm basis for continued development of anti-c-Met treatment, particularly for patients with basal-like and triple-negative breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Summary
Background
Cabozantinib is an oral inhibitor of tyrosine kinases including MET, VEGFR, and AXL. The randomised phase 3 METEOR trial compared the efficacy and safety of cabozantinib versus the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who progressed after previous VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment. Here, we report the final overall survival results from this study based on an unplanned second interim analysis.
Methods
In this open-label, randomised phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients aged 18 years and older with advanced or metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, measurable disease, and previous treatment with one or more VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors to receive 60 mg cabozantinib once a day or 10 mg everolimus once a day. Randomisation was done with an interactive voice and web response system. Stratification factors were Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center risk group and the number of previous treatments with VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival as assessed by an independent radiology review committee in the first 375 randomly assigned patients and has been previously reported. Secondary endpoints were overall survival and objective response in all randomly assigned patients assessed by intention-to-treat. Safety was assessed per protocol in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The study is closed for enrolment but treatment and follow-up of patients is ongoing for long-term safety evaluation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01865747.
Findings
Between Aug 8, 2013, and Nov 24, 2014, 658 patients were randomly assigned to receive cabozantinib (n=330) or everolimus (n=328). The median duration of follow-up for overall survival and safety was 18$\cdot$7 months (IQR 16$\cdot$1\textendash{}21$\cdot$1) in the cabozantinib group and 18$\cdot$8 months (16$\cdot$0\textendash{}21$\cdot$2) in the everolimus group. Median overall survival was 21$\cdot$4 months (95\% CI 18$\cdot$7\textendash{}not estimable) with cabozantinib and 16$\cdot$5 months (14$\cdot$7\textendash{}18$\cdot$8) with everolimus (hazard ratio [HR] 0$\cdot$66 [95\% CI 0$\cdot$53\textendash{}0$\cdot$83]; p=0$\cdot$00026). Cabozantinib treatment also resulted in improved progression-free survival (HR 0$\cdot$51 [95\% CI 0$\cdot$41\textendash{}0$\cdot$62]; p$<$0$\cdot$0001) and objective response (17\% [13\textendash{}22] with cabozantinib vs 3\% [2\textendash{}6] with everolimus; p$<$0$\cdot$0001) per independent radiology review among all randomised patients. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hypertension (49 [15\%] in the cabozantinib group vs 12 [4\%] in the everolimus group), diarrhoea (43 [13\%] vs 7 [2\%]), fatigue (36 [11\%] vs 24 [7\%]), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (27 [8\%] vs 3 [1\%]), anaemia (19 [6\%] vs 53 [17\%]), hyperglycaemia (3 [1\%] vs 16 [5\%]), and hypomagnesaemia (16 [5\%] vs none). Serious adverse events grade 3 or worse occurred in 130 (39\%) patients in the cabozantinib group and in 129 (40\%) in the everolimus group. One treatment-related death occurred in the cabozantinib group (death; not otherwise specified) and two occurred in the everolimus group (one aspergillus infection and one pneumonia aspiration).
Interpretation
Treatment with cabozantinib increased overall survival, delayed disease progression, and improved the objective response compared with everolimus. Based on these results, cabozantinib should be considered as a new standard-of-care treatment option for previously treated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Patients should be monitored for adverse events that might require dose modifications.

  abstract = {Summary
Background
RET rearrangements are found in 1\textendash{}2\% of non-small-cell lung cancers. Cabozantinib is a multikinase inhibitor with activity against RET that produced a 10\% overall response in unselected patients with lung cancers. To assess the activity of cabozantinib in patients with RET-rearranged lung cancers, we did a prospective phase 2 trial in this molecular subgroup.
Methods
We enrolled patients in this open-label, Simon two-stage, single-centre, phase 2, single-arm trial in the USA if they met the following criteria: metastatic or unresectable lung cancer harbouring a RET rearrangement, Karnofsky performance status higher than 70, and measurable disease. Patients were given 60 mg of cabozantinib orally per day. The primary objective was to determine the overall response (Response Criteria Evaluation in Solid Tumors version 1.1) in assessable patients; those who received at least one dose of cabozantinib, and had been given CT imaging at baseline and at least one protocol-specified follow-up timepoint. We did safety analyses in the modified intention-to-treat population who received at least one dose of cabozantinib. The accrual of patients with RET-rearranged lung cancer to this protocol has been completed but the trial is still ongoing because several patients remain on active treatment. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01639508.
Findings
Between July 13, 2012, and April 30, 2016, 26 patients with RET-rearranged lung adenocarcinomas were enrolled and given cabozantinib; 25 patients were assessable for a response. KIF5B-RET was the predominant fusion type identified in 16 (62\%) patients. The study met its primary endpoint, with confirmed partial responses seen in seven of 25 response-assessable patients (overall response 28\%, 95\% CI 12\textendash{}49). Of the 26 patients given cabozantinib, the most common grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were lipase elevation in four (15\%) patients, increased alanine aminotransferase in two (8\%) patients, increased aspartate aminotransferase in two (8\%) patients, decreased platelet count in two (8\%) patients, and hypophosphataemia in two (8\%) patients. No drug-related deaths were recorded but 16 (62\%) patients died during the course of follow-up. 19 (73\%) patients required dose reductions due to drug-related adverse events.
Interpretation
The reported activity of cabozantinib in patients with RET-rearranged lung cancers defines RET rearrangements as actionable drivers in patients with lung cancers. An improved understanding of tumour biology and novel therapeutic approaches will be needed to improve outcomes with RET-directed targeted treatment.

  abstract = {Purpose: Rearranged ROS1 is a crizotinib-sensitive oncogenic driver in lung cancer. The development of acquired resistance, however, poses a serious clinical challenge. Consequently, experimental and clinical validation of resistance mechanisms and potential second-line therapies is essential.
Experimental Design: We report the discovery of a novel, solvent-front ROS1D2033N mutation in a patient with CD74-ROS1\textendash{}rearranged lung adenocarcinoma and acquired resistance to crizotinib. Crizotinib resistance of CD74-ROS1D2033N was functionally evaluated using cell-based assays and structural modeling.
Results: In biochemical and cell-based assays, the CD74-ROS1D2033N mutant demonstrated significantly decreased sensitivity to crizotinib. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed compromised crizotinib binding due to drastic changes in the electrostatic interaction between the D2033 residue and crizotinib and reorientation of neighboring residues. In contrast, cabozantinib binding was unaffected by the D2033N substitution, and inhibitory potency against the mutant was retained. Notably, cabozantinib treatment resulted in a rapid clinical and near-complete radiographic response in this patient.
Conclusions: These results provide the first example of successful therapeutic intervention with targeted therapy to overcome crizotinib resistance in a ROS1-rearranged cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 22(10); 2351\textendash{}8. \textcopyright{}2015 AACR.},

EXAM, a randomized double-blind placebo (P)-controlled study in patients (pts) with progressive, locally advanced, or metastatic MTC (NCT00704730), met its primary end point with a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28, p $<$ 0.001) (Elisei et al, JCO, 2013). This report contains the final analysis of the secondary endpoint, Overall Survival (OS).  Methods:  Eligible pts were required to have documented RECIST progression within 14 months (mo) of screening, and were randomized 2:1 to receive Cabo (140 mg qd) or P. Crossover between treatment arms was not allowed. The primary endpoint was PFS assessed by RECIST via independent review. The study was designed with 80\% power to detect a HR of 0.667 for the secondary endpoint of OS.   Results:  At the final analysis, median follow up time was 52.4 mo. 218 events were recorded in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (N = 330). The estimated median OS was 26.6 mo for Cabo vs 21.1 mo for P (stratified HR = 0.85; 95\% CI 0.64-1.12; p  =  0.241). For 126 pts with known RET M918T mutations, median OS was 44.3 mo for Cabo vs 18.9 mo for P (HR = 0.60, p = 0.026). 32\% of Cabo-treated pts received subsequent systemic anticancer therapy vs 50\% for P-treated pts. The median duration of treatment was 10.8 mo for Cabo and 3.5 mo for P. 46\% and 26\% of Cabo-treated pts remained on study treatment for over 1 year and 2 years, and 10\% and 1.8\% for P, respectively. The most common serious adverse events ( $\geq$ 2\%) on the Cabo arm were pneumonia (4.2\%), pulmonary embolism (3.3\%), mucosal inflammation (2.8\%), hypocalcemia (2.8\%), hypertension, dysphagia, dehydration and lung abscess (2.3\% each).  Conclusions:  The secondary endpoint of improved OS was not met, with a median OS 5.5 mo longer with Cabo compared to P that did not reach significance in the ITT population. OS improvement with Cabo was greatest in patients with RET M918T mutations, with a 25.4-month increase in median OS compared to P. The safety profile of Cabo remained consistent with longer term exposure. Clinical trial information: NCT00704730.},

  abstract = {9068Background: The RET inhibitor cabozantinib is active in pts with RET-rearranged lung cancers. We previously reported an overall response rate of 38\% on an ongoing phase 2 study (Drilon ASCO 2015), implying that a proportion of tumors may harbor intrinsic resistance. Furthermore, tumors that respond eventually progress due to the development of secondary resistance. Molecular mechanisms that underlie resistance to cabozantinib are poorly understood. Methods: Paired pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies were obtained from pts with RET-rearranged lung cancers treated with cabozantinib on our phase 2 trial (NCT01639508) or off-protocol. Broad, hybrid-capture NGS (MSK-IMPACT/FoundationOne) was performed to identify concurrent genomic alterations. RET-rearranged cell lines and xenografts were treated with cabozantinib and the MDM2 inhibitors AMG232 and RG7388. Results: NGS was performed on 16 pre- and 6 post-cabozantinib tumor samples. De-novo MDM2 (p53 antagonist) amp or TP53 mutation were identified in pre-treatment tumors from 8/16 (50\%) pts. Acquired MDM2 amp was identified in post-cabozantinib recurrences from 2/4 (50\%) pts with paired samples who developed resistance. In a separate group of 3,842 lung cancer pts, NGS detected concurrent MDM2 amp in 20\% of tumors with RET fusions (p $<$ 0.01). A cell line and xenograft were established from a pt with a TRIM33-RET+ tumor that developed acquired MDM2 amp after progression on cabozantinib. MDM2 inhibitors reduced cell line growth (IC50 0.07$\mathrm{\mu}$M AMG232, 0.02$\mathrm{\mu}$M RG7388), induced expression of p53-dependent genes, and activated caspase 3/7 in a p53- and PUMA-dependent manner. Growth was suppressed 60-90\% by shRNAs targeting MDM2. Xenograft treatment with AMG232 or RG7388 resulted in 60-90\% tumor volume reduction. A combination of cabozantinib and AMG232 was more effective at suppressing tumor growth than either agent alone. Ectopic MDM2 expression in NIH-3T3 cells transformed with CCDC6-RET resulted in reduced cabozantinib sensitivity. Conclusions: MDM2 amplification is a potential mechanism of primary or acquired resistance to cabozantinib. MDM2 inhibitors in clinical development can be employed as viable targeted therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Therapeutic targeting of the epithelial compartment alone in prostate cancer has resulted in unfavorable outcomes, including the development of resistance. Cabozantinib (XL184), a small molecule inhibitor of tyrosine kinases including c-MET and VEGFR2 has been shown to decrease tumor growth and metastasis. Our working rationale is that therapeutic strategies that target the prostate tumor microenvironment would have improved outcomes compared with those that solely target the cancer epithelia. Cabozantinib is demonstrated to have a role in inhibiting osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation and thereby limit prostate cancer (PCa) bone lesions, as determined by technetium-99 bone scan. However, the ultimate survival benefit of castrate resistant prostate cancer patients treated with cabozantinib has not born out in recent clinical trials for PCa patients with bone metastasis. In this study, utilizing various pre-clinical xenograft mouse models, prostate epithelial cell lines and human and mouse prostate fibroblasts, we investigated the effect of cabozantinib on prostate tumor microenvironment and delineated the cellular targets of cabozantnib. We found that cabozantinib affects prostate stromal cells at a significantly lower concentration compared with epithelial cells in vitro. We found that human cancer associated fibroblasts pre-treated with cabozantinib induced a significantly increased tumor growth in the intra-tibial mouse model of growth in the bone microenvironment. Further, in a novel and surprising discovery, we found that cabozantinib alters the immune microenvironment by reducing the M1 macrophages. However, cabozantinib depleted both basal and luminal epithelial progenitor cells in vivo. Taken together, we found that cabozantnib can have a tumor potentiating role by limiting M1 macrophages, yet the down regulation of carcinoma associated fibroblasts and associated epithelial progenitors could suggest interesting combination therapies. A lower dose of cabozantnib with traditional anti-proliferative therapies, like taxanes or radiation is supported by the pre-clinical experiments.

This randomized phase II multicenter trial evaluated cabozantinib compared with sunitinib as first-line therapy in patients with mRCC.Patients and MethodsEligible patients had untreated clear cell mRCC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 and were intermediate or poor risk per International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium criteria. Patients were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to cabozantinib (60 mg once per day) or sunitinib (50 mg once per day; 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off). Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end point. Objective response rate (ORR), overall survival, and safety were secondary end points.ResultsFrom July 2013 to April 2015, 157 patients were randomly assigned (cabozantinib, n = 79; sunitinib, n = 78). Compared with sunitinib, cabozantinib treatment significantly increased median PFS (8.2 v 5.6 months) and was associated with a 34\% reduction in rate of progression or death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.46 to 0.95; one-sided P = .012). ORR was 33\% (95\% CI, 23\% to 44\%) for cabozantinib versus 12\% (95\% CI, 5.4\% to 21\%) for sunitinib. All-causality grade 3 or 4 adverse events were 67\% for cabozantinib and 68\% for sunitinib and included diarrhea (cabozantinib, 10\% v sunitinib, 11\%), fatigue (6\% v 15\%), hypertension (28\% v 22\%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (8\% v 4\%), and hematologic adverse events (3\% v 22\%).ConclusionCabozantinib demonstrated a significant clinical benefit in PFS and ORR over standard-of-care sunitinib as first-line therapy in patients with intermediate- or poor-risk mRCC.},

  abstract = {The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is activated in various types of cancer including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. It has been shown that extremely low oxygen tension (below 1\% O2) is found in tumor tissue including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells (PDAC) and increases the invasiveness of PDAC. To investigate the contribution of the Hh pathway to hypoxia-induced invasiveness, we examined how hypoxia affects Hh pathway activation and the invasiveness of PDAC. In the present study, three human PDAC lines were cultured under normoxic (20\% O2) or hypoxic (1\% O2) conditions. Hypoxia upregulated the transcription of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Smoothened (Smo), Gli1 and matrix metalloproteinase9 (MMP9) and increased the invasiveness of PDAC. Significantly, neither the addition of recombinant Shh (rhShh) nor the silencing of Shh affected the transcription of these genes and the invasiveness of PDAC. On the other hand, silencing of Smo decreased the transcription of Gli1 and MMP9 and PDAC invasiveness. Silencing of Gli1 or MMP9 decreased PDAC invasiveness. These results suggest that hypoxia activates the Hh pathway of PDAC by increasing the transcription of Smo in a ligand-independent manner and increases PDAC invasiveness.

  abstract = {Carbonic anhydrase-9 (CA9), a transmembrane enzyme with an extracellular active site, is involved in the reversible metabolism of the carbon dioxide to carbonic acid. Up-regulation of CA by hypoxia and the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway has been recently postulated (Wykoff et al. Cancer Res., 60: 7075\textendash{}7083, 2000). In the present study we examined the expression of this enzyme in non-small cell lung cancer. Of 107 cases analyzed, 39 (36.4\%) had strong membrane/cytoplasmic expression of CA9 and were grouped as positive. The staining was confined around areas of necrosis, and a significant association of CA9 expression with the extent of necrosis was noted (P = 0.004). Nevertheless, 38 of 74 cases with focal or extensive necrosis did not express CA9. CA9 expression was more frequent in the squamous cell histology (P = 0.001) and with advanced T stage (P = 0.009). A significant coexpression of CA9 with platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor receptor expression was noted. Double staining of CA9 with anti-CD31 monoclonal antibody revealed an overall higher microvessel density in the areas expressing CA9 than in negative areas (P = 0.0005). Thirty-one of 38 CA9-positive cases were positive for HIF1a/HIF2a, but HIF positivity was a more common event (68 of 107) and their patterns of expression were diffuse (not confined in the necrotic areas). A direct association of CA9 expression with epidermal growth factor receptor, c-erbB-2, and MUC1 expression was also noted (P $<$ 0.04). Survival analysis showed that CA9 expression is related to poor prognosis. CA9 expression in tumors with low vascularization defined a prognosis similar to the one of patients with highly angiogenic tumors. Multivariate analysis revealed that CA9 expression is a significant prognostic factor independent of angiogenesis. We conclude that CA9 is an important molecule in non-small cell lung cancer, the up-regulation of which occurs in highly hypoxic/necrotic regions of the tumors. The expression of CA9 is linked to the expression of a constellation of proteins involved in angiogenesis, apoptosis inhibition, and cell-cell adhesion disruption, which explains the strong association of CA9 with poor outcome.},

HIF-1 alpha is most closely related to Sim. HIF-1 beta is a series of ARNT gene products, which can thus heterodimerize with either HIF-1 alpha or AHR.

  abstract = {Expression of programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 (PDL1) has been scarcely studied in breast cancer. Recently PD1/PDL1-inhibitors have shown promising results in different carcinomas with correlation between PDL1 tumor expression and responses. We retrospectively analyzed PDL1 mRNA expression in 45 breast cancer cell lines and 5,454 breast cancers profiled using DNA microarrays. Compared to normal breast samples, PDL1 expression was upregulated in 20\% of clinical samples and 38\% of basal tumors. High expression was associated with poor-prognosis features (large tumor size, high grade, ER-negative, PR-negative, ERBB2-positive status, high proliferation, basal and ERBB2-enriched subtypes). PDL1 upregulation was associated with biological signs of strong cytotoxic local immune response. PDL1 upregulation was not associated with survival in the whole population, but was associated with better metastasis-free and overall specific survivals in basal tumors, independently of clinicopathological features. Pathological complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was higher in case of PDL1 upregulation (50\% versus 21\%). In conclusion, PDL1 upregulation, more frequent in basal breast cancers, was associated with increased T-cell cytotoxic immune response. In this aggressive subtype, upregulation was associated with better survival and response to chemotherapy. Reactivation of dormant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes by PDL1-inhibitors could represent promising strategy in PDL1-upregulated basal breast cancer.},

  volume = {7},
  issn = {1949-2553},
  abstract = {Aims
Antibodies targeting the checkpoint molecules programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 are emerging cancer therapeutics. We systematically investigated PD-1 and PD-L1 expression patterns in the poor-prognosis tumor entity high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.

Methods
PD-1 and PD-L1 protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays from 215 primary cancers both in cancer cells and in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). mRNA expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. An in silico validation of mRNA data was performed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.

Results
PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in cancer cells, CD3+, PD-1+, and PD-L1+ TILs densities as well as PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA levels were positive prognostic factors for progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), with all factors being significant for PFS (p $<$ 0.035 each), and most being significant for OS. Most factors also had prognostic value that was independent from age, stage, and residual tumor. Moreover, high PD-1+ TILs as well as PD-L1+ TILs densities added prognostic value to CD3+TILs (PD-1+: p = 0.002,; PD-L1+: p = 0.002). The significant positive prognostic impact of PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA expression could be reproduced in the TCGA gene expression datasets (p = 0.02 and p $<$ 0.0001, respectively).

Conclusions
Despite their reported immune-modulatory function, high PD-1 and PD-L1 levels are indicators of a favorable prognosis in ovarian cancer. Our data indicate that PD-1 and PD-L1 molecules are biologically relevant regulators of the immune response in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, which is an argument for the evaluation of immune checkpoint inhibiting drugs in this tumor entity.},

While immunohistochemical detection of PD-L1 was introduced as a predictive biomarker with variable power, much less is known about copy number alterations (CNA) affecting PD-L1 and their associations with expression levels, mutational load, and survival. To gain insight, we employed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets to comprehensively analyze 22 major cancer types for PD-L1 CNAs. We observed a diverse landscape of PD-L1 CNAs, which affected focal regions, chromosome 9p or the entire chromosome 9. Deletions of PD-L1 were more frequent than gains (31\% vs. 12\%) with deletions being most prevalent in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Copy number gains most frequently occurred in ovarian cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, cervical and endocervical cancer, sarcomas, and colorectal cancers. Fine-mapping of the genetic architecture revealed specific recurrently amplified and deleted core regions across cancers with putative biological and clinical consequences. PD-L1 CNAs correlated significantly with PD-L1 mRNA expression changes in many cancer types, and tumors with PD-L1 gains harbored significantly higher mutational load compared to non-amplified cases (median: 78 non-synonymous mutations vs. 40, P\,=\,7.1e-69). Moreover, we observed that, in general, both PD-L1 amplifications and deletions were associated with dismal prognosis. In conclusion, PD-L1 CNAs, in particular PD-L1 copy number gains, represent frequent genetic alterations across many cancers, which influence PD-L1 expression levels, are associated with higher mutational loads, and may be exploitable as predictive biomarker for immunotherapy regimens. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Summary
Background
The anti-programmed-death-receptor-1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab has shown potent antitumour activity at different doses and schedules in patients with melanoma. We compared the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab at doses of 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks in patients with ipilimumab-refractory advanced melanoma.
Methods
In an open-label, international, multicentre expansion cohort of a phase 1 trial, patients (aged $\geq$18 years) with advanced melanoma whose disease had progressed after at least two ipilimumab doses were randomly assigned with a computer-generated allocation schedule (1:1 final ratio) to intravenous pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) assessed with the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) by independent central review. Analysis was done on the full-analysis set (all treated patients with measurable disease at baseline). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01295827.
Findings
173 patients received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (n=89) or 10 mg/kg (n=84). Median follow-up duration was 8 months. ORR was 26\% at both doses\textemdash{}21 of 81 patients in the 2 mg/kg group and 20 of 76 in the 10 mg/kg group (difference 0\%, 95\% CI -14 to 13; p=0$\cdot$96). Treatment was well tolerated, with similar safety profiles in the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups and no drug-related deaths. The most common drug-related adverse events of any grade in the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups were fatigue (29 [33\%] vs 31 [37\%]), pruritus (23 [26\%] vs 16 [19\%]), and rash (16 [18\%] vs 15 [18\%]). Grade 3 fatigue, reported in five (3\%) patients in the 2 mg/kg pembrolizumab group, was the only drug-related grade 3 to 4 adverse event reported in more than one patient.
Interpretation
The results suggest that pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks might be an effective treatment in patients for whom there are few effective treatment options.

We provide updated efficacy data and correlation with tumor PD-L1 expression.  Methods:  135 pts received MK-3475 10 mg/kg Q2W (n = 57), 10 mg/kg Q3W (n = 56), or 2 mg/kg Q3W (n = 22). Response was assessed every 12 wk by RECIST 1.1 by independent central review and by immune-related response criteria (irRC) by investigator. Biopsy was required in the 60 d before MK-3475. Tumor PD-L1 expression was assessed by IHC. A preliminary cutoff of 1\% of stained tumor cells defined PD-L1 positivity.  Results:  As of 10/18/2013, all pts had $\geq$13 mo follow-up. Median time on treatment was 23 wk (range, 1 dose to 97 wk). In pts with measurable disease, ORR was 41\% by RECIST (Table). Objective responses were observed as late as 64 wk, with some conversions to CR seen as late as 72 wk. Median response duration was not reached; responses were ongoing for 87\% of responders. Median PFS was 31 wk. Median OS was not reached, and OS rate at 1 y was 81\%. Tumor PD-L1 expression was evaluable in 71 pts with measurable disease and $\geq$1 tumor evaluation (77\% PD-L1+). Of these pts, PD-L1 expression was associated with improved ORR by RECIST (51\% vs 6\%, P = .0012 [Fisher's exact]) and PFS (median 12 vs 3 mo, HR 0.31, 95\% CI 0.16-0.61, P = .0004 [log-rank]). 1-y OS rate was 84\% in PD-L1+ and 69\% in PD-L1\textendash{} pts (P = .2146 [log-rank]). There were no treatment-related deaths; 14\% of pts experienced drug-related grade 3/4 AEs.  Conclusions:  MK-3475 induces durable responses and favorable 1-y OS with acceptable safety in MEL. Although tumor PD-L1 positivity was associated with improved ORR and PFS, antitumor activity was also observed in pts with low baseline PD-L1 expression.

  abstract = {Purpose: PD-L1 is the main ligand for the immune inhibitory receptor PD-1. This ligand is frequently expressed by melanoma cells. In this study, we investigated whether PD-L1 expression is controlled by melanoma driver mutations and modified by oncogenic signaling inhibition.
Experimental Design: Expression of PD-L1 was investigated in a panel of 51 melanoma cell lines containing different oncogenic mutations, including cell lines with innate and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). The effects of targeted therapy drugs on expression of PD-L1 by melanoma cells were investigated.
Results: No association was found between the level of PD-L1 expression and mutations in BRAF, NRAS, PTEN, or amplification of AKT. Resistance to vemurafenib due to the activation of alternative signaling pathways was accompanied with the induction of PD-L1 expression, whereas the resistance due to the reactivation of the MAPK pathway had no effect on PD-L1 expression. In melanoma cell lines, the effects of BRAF, MEK, and PI3K inhibitors on expression of PD-L1 were variable from reduction to induction, particularly in the presence of INF$\gamma$. In PD-L1\textendash{}exposed lymphocytes, vemurafenib paradoxically restored activity of the MAPK pathway and increased the secretion of cytokines.
Conclusions: In melanoma cell lines, including BRAFi-resistant cells, PD-L1 expression is variably regulated by oncogenic signaling pathways. PD-L1\textendash{}exposed lymphocytes decrease MAPK signaling, which is corrected by exposure to vemurafenib, providing potential benefits of combining this drug with immunotherapies.

  abstract = {Summary
Background
Patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma have few treatment options after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. In this trial, we assessed treatment with atezolizumab, an engineered humanised immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), in this patient population.
Methods
For this multicentre, single-arm, two-cohort, phase 2 trial, patients (aged $\geq$18 years) with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease had progressed after previous platinum-based chemotherapy were enrolled from 70 major academic medical centres and community oncology practices in Europe and North America. Key inclusion criteria for enrolment were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, measurable disease defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), adequate haematological and end-organ function, and no autoimmune disease or active infections. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour specimens with sufficient viable tumour content were needed from all patients before enrolment. Patients received treatment with intravenous atezolizumab (1200 mg, given every 3 weeks). PD-L1 expression on tumour-infiltrating immune cells (ICs) was assessed prospectively by immunohistochemistry. The co-primary endpoints were the independent review facility-assessed objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1 and the investigator-assessed objective response rate according to immune-modified RECIST, analysed by intention to treat. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to assess whether the objective response rate was significantly higher than the historical control rate of 10\% at an $\alpha$ level of 0$\cdot$05. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02108652.
Findings
Between May 13, 2014, and Nov 19, 2014, 486 patients were screened and 315 patients were enrolled into the study. Of these patients, 310 received atezolizumab treatment (five enrolled patients later did not meet eligibility criteria and were not dosed with study drug). The PD-L1 expression status on infiltrating immune cells (ICs) in the tumour microenvironment was defined by the percentage of PD-L1-positive immune cells: IC0 ($<$1\%), IC1 ($\geq$1\% but $<$5\%), and IC2/3 ($\geq$5\%). The primary analysis (data cutoff May 5, 2015) showed that compared with a historical control overall response rate of 10\%, treatment with atezolizumab resulted in a significantly improved RECIST v1.1 objective response rate for each prespecified immune cell group (IC2/3: 27\% [95\% CI 19\textendash{}37], p$<$0$\cdot$0001; IC1/2/3: 18\% [13\textendash{}24], p=0$\cdot$0004) and in all patients (15\% [11\textendash{}20], p=0$\cdot$0058). With longer follow-up (data cutoff Sept 14, 2015), by independent review, objective response rates were 26\% (95\% CI 18\textendash{}36) in the IC2/3 group, 18\% (13\textendash{}24) in the IC1/2/3 group, and 15\% (11\textendash{}19) overall in all 310 patients. With a median follow-up of 11$\cdot$7 months (95\% CI 11$\cdot$4\textendash{}12$\cdot$2), ongoing responses were recorded in 38 (84\%) of 45 responders. Exploratory analyses showed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) subtypes and mutation load to be independently predictive for response to atezolizumab. Grade 3\textendash{}4 treatment-related adverse events, of which fatigue was the most common (five patients [2\%]), occurred in 50 (16\%) of 310 treated patients. Grade 3\textendash{}4 immune-mediated adverse events occurred in 15 (5\%) of 310 treated patients, with pneumonitis, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alanine aminotransferase, rash, and dyspnoea being the most common. No treatment-related deaths occurred during the study.
Interpretation
Atezolizumab showed durable activity and good tolerability in this patient population. Increased levels of PD-L1 expression on immune cells were associated with increased response. This report is the first to show the association of TCGA subtypes with response to immune checkpoint inhibition and to show the importance of mutation load as a biomarker of response to this class of agents in advanced urothelial carcinoma.

  abstract = {Summary
Background
First-line chemotherapy for patients with cisplatin-ineligible locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma is associated with short response duration, poor survival, and high toxicity. This study assessed atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) as treatment for metastatic urothelial cancer in cisplatin-ineligible patients.
Methods
For this single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 study, in 47 academic medical centres and community oncology practices in seven countries in North America and Europe, we recruited previously untreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were cisplatin ineligible. Patients were given 1200 mg intravenous atezolizumab every 21 days until progression. The primary endpoint was independently confirmed objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (central review), assessed in prespecified subgroups based on PD-L1 expression and in all patients. All participants who received one or more doses of atezolizumab were included in the primary and safety analyses. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02108652.
Findings
Between June 9, 2014, and March 30, 2015, we enrolled 123 patients, of whom 119 received one or more doses of atezolizumab. At 17$\cdot$2 months' median follow-up, the objective response rate was 23\% (95\% CI 16 to 31), the complete response rate was 9\% (n=11), and 19 of 27 responses were ongoing. Median response duration was not reached. Responses occurred across all PD-L1 and poor prognostic factor subgroups. Median progression-free survival was 2$\cdot$7 months (2$\cdot$1 to 4$\cdot$2). Median overall survival was 15$\cdot$9 months (10$\cdot$4 to not estimable). Tumour mutation load was associated with response. Treatment-related adverse events that occurred in 10\% or more of patients were fatigue (36 [30\%] patients), diarrhoea (14 [12\%] patients), and pruritus (13 [11\%] patients). One treatment-related death (sepsis) occurred. Nine (8\%) patients had an adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation. Immune-mediated events occurred in 14 (12\%) patients.
Interpretation
Atezolizumab showed encouraging durable response rates, survival, and tolerability, supporting its therapeutic use in untreated metastatic urothelial cancer.

  abstract = {Summary
Background
Outcomes are poor for patients with previously treated, advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab is clinically active against cancer, including NSCLC, especially cancers expressing PD-L1 on tumour cells, tumour-infiltrating immune cells, or both. We assessed efficacy and safety of atezolizumab versus docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC, analysed by PD-L1 expression levels on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells and in the intention-to-treat population.
Methods
In this open-label, phase 2 randomised controlled trial, patients with NSCLC who progressed on post-platinum chemotherapy were recruited in 61 academic medical centres and community oncology practices across 13 countries in Europe and North America. Key inclusion criteria were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), and adequate haematological and end-organ function. Patients were stratified by PD-L1 tumour-infiltrating immune cell status, histology, and previous lines of therapy, and randomly assigned (1:1) by permuted block randomisation (with a block size of four) using an interactive voice or web system to receive intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks. Baseline PD-L1 expression was scored by immunohistochemistry in tumour cells (as percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells TC3$\geq$50\%, TC2$\geq$5\% and $<$50\%, TC1$\geq$1\% and $<$5\%, and TC0$<$1\%) and tumour-infiltrating immune cells (as percentage of tumour area: IC3$\geq$10\%, IC2$\geq$5\% and $<$10\%, IC1$\geq$1\% and $<$5\%, and IC0$<$1\%). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population and PD-L1 subgroups at 173 deaths. Biomarkers were assessed in an exploratory analysis. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01903993.
Findings
Patients were enrolled between Aug 5, 2013, and March 31, 2014. 144 patients were randomly allocated to the atezolizumab group, and 143 to the docetaxel group. 142 patients received at least one dose of atezolizumab and 135 received docetaxel. Overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 12$\cdot$6 months (95\% CI 9$\cdot$7\textendash{}16$\cdot$4) for atezolizumab versus 9$\cdot$7 months (8$\cdot$6\textendash{}12$\cdot$0) for docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0$\cdot$73 [95\% CI 0$\cdot$53\textendash{}0$\cdot$99]; p=0$\cdot$04). Increasing improvement in overall survival was associated with increasing PD-L1 expression (TC3 or IC3 HR 0$\cdot$49 [0$\cdot$22\textendash{}1$\cdot$07; p=0$\cdot$068], TC2/3 or IC2/3 HR 0$\cdot$54 [0$\cdot$33\textendash{}0$\cdot$89; p=0$\cdot$014], TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 HR 0$\cdot$59 [0$\cdot$40\textendash{}0$\cdot$85; p=0$\cdot$005], TC0 and IC0 HR 1$\cdot$04 [0$\cdot$62\textendash{}1$\cdot$75; p=0$\cdot$871]). In our exploratory analysis, patients with pre-existing immunity, defined by high T-effector\textendash{}interferon-$\gamma$-associated gene expression, had improved overall survival with atezolizumab. 11 (8\%) patients in the atezolizumab group discontinued because of adverse events versus 30 (22\%) patients in the docetaxel group. 16 (11\%) patients in the atezolizumab group versus 52 (39\%) patients in the docetaxel group had treatment-related grade 3\textendash{}4 adverse events, and one ($<$1\%) patient in the atezolizumab group versus three (2\%) patients in the docetaxel group died from a treatment-related adverse event.
Interpretation
Atezolizumab significantly improved survival compared with docetaxel in patients with previously treated NSCLC. Improvement correlated with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, suggesting that PD-L1 expression is predictive for atezolizumab benefit. Atezolizumab was well tolerated, with a safety profile distinct from chemotherapy.

  abstract = {Background: The programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) are key therapeutic targets in the reactivation of the immune response against cancer. Avelumab* (MSB0010718C) is a fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 antibody being investigated in clinical trials. We report clinical activity of avelumab in a cohort of patients (pts) with locally advanced (LA) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) refractory to or progressing after standard-of-care therapy (NCT01772004).
Methods: Pts received avelumab at 10 mg/kg Q2W until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for withdrawal occurred. Tumors were assessed every 6 wks (RECIST 1.1). Unconfirmed best overall response was evaluated. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by NCI-CTCAE v4.0. Biopsy or surgical specimens were collected within 90 days prior to 1st dose of avelumab for biomarker analyses. Tumor PD-L1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using various cutoff criteria.
Results: As of 27 Feb 2015, 168 pts (167 female, 1 male) with MBC, including ductal (56.5\%), carcinoma NOS (9.5\%), lobular (3.6\%), or other (30.4\%), were treated with avelumab and followed for a median of 10 mo (range 6-15). Median age was 55y (range 31-81), ECOG performance status was 0 (49.4\%) or 1 (50.6\%), and pts had received a median of 3 prior therapies for LA/M disease (range 0-10; pts must have received prior treatment with taxane and anthracycline, unless contraindicated). Pts were HER2\textendash/ER+ or PR+ (69 [41.1\%]), triple negative (TNBC = HER2\textendash/ER\textendash/PR\textendash; 57 [33.9\%]), HER2+ (26 [15.5\%]), or had unknown biomarker status (16 [9.5\%]). Median duration of treatment was 8 wks (range 2-50), and 9 pts (5.4\%) remained on avelumab. Any grade treatment-related treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) occurred in 120 pts (71.4\%); the most common ($>$10\%) were fatigue (33 [19.6\%]), nausea (24 [14.3\%]), and infusion-related reactions (20 [11.9\%]). Treatment-related grade $\geq$3 TEAEs occurred in 24 pts (14.3\%) and included ($\geq$1\%) fatigue, anemia, increased GGT, and autoimmune hepatitis (each 3 [1.8\%]), and arthralgia (2 [1.2\%]). There were 2 treatment-related deaths (acute liver failure, respiratory distress). Unconfirmed objective response rate (ORR) in the entire cohort was 5.4\% (9 pts; 95\% CI: 2.5, 9.9), with 1 CR and 8 PRs. Five of 9 responses were ongoing at time of cutoff. Stable disease was observed in additional 40 pts (23.8\%), for an overall disease control rate of 29.2\%. Evidence of tumor reduction by $\geq$30\% was seen in 15 pts (8.9\%). There were responders in all biomarker subgroups, including 5 PRs in TNBC (n=57 [8.8\%; 95\% CI: 2.9, 19.3]). PD-L1 expression was evaluable in 136 pts. Among all pts with PD-L1 expressing immune cells within the tumor, 33.3\% (4 of 12) had PRs. In pts with TNBC who had PD-L1+ immune cells within the tumor, 44.4\% (4 of 9) had PRs, compared with 2.6\% (1 of 39) for TNBC and PD-L1\textendash{} immune cells.
Conclusions: Avelumab showed an acceptable safety profile and had clinical activity in a subset of pts with MBC. In pts with TNBC, presence of PD-L1 expressing immune cells within the tumor may be associated with clinical responses to avelumab. Further analyses of PD-L1 expression and clinical activity of avelumab in MBC are ongoing. *Proposed INN.

  abstract = {5509  Background:  The programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) are key therapeutic targets in the reactivation of the immune response against multiple cancers. Avelumab (proposed INN) (MSB0010718C) is a fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 antibody currently being investigated in clinical trials. Here we present results from a cohort of patients (pts) with recurrent or refractory ovarian cancer in an ongoing phase Ib study (NCT01772004).  Methods:  Pts with ECOG PS 0-1 received avelumab at 10 mg/kg Q2W. Best overall response (BOR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed according to RECIST 1.1. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated by CTCAE v4.0. A prespecified analysis of 23 pts with follow-up of $\geq$ 2 months showed confirmed and unconfirmed partial responses (PRs), leading to cohort expansion to 75 pts.  Results:  Seventy-five pts were enrolled from November 2013 to November 2014 (median age 62 [range 38-84]; ECOG PS 0 [41\%] or 1 [59\%]; median of four prior lines of therapy). As of January 2015, median duration of treatment with avelumab was 10 weeks (range 2-54 weeks), and 27 pts remained on treatment. Efficacy data from the 23 pts followed-up for $\geq$ 2 months (range 2\textendash{}8 months) demonstrated 4 pts (17.4\%, [95\% CI, 5.0\%, 38.8\%]) achieved an unconfirmed BOR of PR,11 (47.8\%) had stable disease, and 2 pts had $>$30\% tumor shrinkage after progression was reported. Median PFS was 11.9 weeks (95\% CI, 5.9, not reached), and the PFS rate at 24 weeks was 33.3\% (95\% CI, 11.5, 57.2). Drug-related treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs; all grades) were reported in 18 pts (78.3\%), and 2 pts (8.7\%) experienced grade $\geq$ 3 drug-related TEAEs (increased lipase [1] and elevated creatine kinase and autoimmune myositis that led to discontinuation [1]). No drug-related serious TEAEs occurred. The most commonly reported drug-related TEAEs ($>$ 10\%) were fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.  Conclusions:  These data represent the largest reported dataset of pts with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Avelumab demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and is clinically active in this heavily pretreated ovarian cancer pt population. Clinical trial information: NCT01772004.},

  abstract = {9029Background: The PD-1/PD-L1 axis is an important immune inhibitory pathway contributing to tumor cell escape from immunosurveillance. A Phase 1/2 dose escalation and dose expansion study is ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of durvalumab, a modified human IgG1 mAb that blocks PD-L1 binding to PD-1 and CD80, in patients with advanced non‒small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or other solid tumor types. Methods: Durvalumab 10 mg/kg is given q2w for up to 12 months to treatment-na{\"\i}ve patients with histologically or cytologically documented Stage IIIB/IV squamous (SQ) or non-SQ NSCLC. Retreatment is permitted if disease progresses after 12 months of therapy. Response is investigator-assessed per RECIST v1.1, and the results are presented by histology and PD-L1 status with the Ventana SP263 assay (PD-L1+ defined as $\geq$ 25\% of tumor cells expressing membrane PD-L1). Fifteen patients were initially enrolled regardless of PD-L1 status. After a protocol amendment, enrollment was restricted to PD-L1+ patients. Results: As of 14 Dec 2015, 59 patients (48 PD-L1+; 9 PD-L1-; 58 EGFR WT; 57 ALK WT; 55 KRAS WT; 29 SQ; 30 non-SQ; median age 66 years [range 31-83]; 64\% male; 96\% current/prior smokers; ECOG 0/1: 37\%/63\%) received a median of 8 doses (range 1-27). Drug-related AEs were reported in 51\% of patients; most frequent were fatigue (15\%), diarrhea (12\%), and decreased appetite (10\%). Grade $\geq$ 3 drug-related AEs were reported in 9\% of patients. Drug-related AEs led to discontinuation in 4 patients (7\%); most frequent was diarrhea (2 patients). Fifty-two patients (23 SQ; 29 non-SQ) were evaluable for response with $\geq$ 12 weeks of follow-up. ORR (confirmed CR and PR) was 25\% (11/43 PD-L1+; 1/8 PD-L1-), and disease control rate at $\geq$ 12 weeks was 56\% (24/43 PD-L1+; 4/8 PD-L1-). ORR was similar for SQ (26\%) and non-SQ (24\%). Responses are ongoing in 9/13 responding patients (duration of response range: 5.7+ to 70.1+ weeks). Conclusions: Durvalumab monotherapy has a manageable safety profile with early evidence of clinical benefit in treatment-na{\"\i}ve SQ or non-SQ advanced NSCLC. A development program of durvalumab alone and in combination is ongoing in advanced NSCLC. Clinical trial information: NCT01693562.},

We report here the results from the UBC expansion cohort. Durvalumab (MEDI4736, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was administered intravenously for up to 12 months. The primary end point was safety, and objective response rate (ORR, confirmed) was a key secondary end point. An exploratory analysis of pretreatment tumor biopsies led to defining PD-L1\textendash{}positive as $\geq$ 25\% of tumor cells or tumor-infiltrating immune cells expressing membrane PD-L1.ResultsA total of 61 patients (40 PD-L1\textendash{}positive, 21 PD-L1\textendash{}negative), 93.4\% of whom received one or more prior therapies for advanced disease, were treated (median duration of follow-up, 4.3 months). The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) of any grade were fatigue (13.1\%), diarrhea (9.8\%), and decreased appetite (8.2\%). Grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in three patients (4.9\%); there were no treatment-related grade 4 or 5 AEs. One treatment-related AE (acute kidney injury) resulted in treatment discontinuation. The ORR was 31.0\% (95\% CI, 17.6 to 47.1) in 42 response-evaluable patients, 46.4\% (95\% CI, 27.5 to 66.1) in the PD-L1\textendash{}positive subgroup, and 0\% (95\% CI, 0.0 to 23.2) in the PD-L1\textendash{}negative subgroup.

  abstract = {An autochthonous model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) permitted the analysis of why immunotherapy is ineffective in this human disease. Despite finding that PDA-bearing mice had cancer cell-specific CD8+ T cells, the mice, like human patients with PDA, did not respond to two immunological checkpoint antagonists that promote the function of T cells: anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ($\alpha$-CTLA-4) and $\alpha$-programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 ($\alpha$-PD-L1). Immune control of PDA growth was achieved, however, by depleting carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that express fibroblast activation protein (FAP). The depletion of the FAP+ stromal cell also uncovered the antitumor effects of $\alpha$-CTLA-4 and $\alpha$-PD-L1, indicating that its immune suppressive activity accounts for the failure of these T-cell checkpoint antagonists. Three findings suggested that chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) explained the overriding immunosuppression by the FAP+ cell: T cells were absent from regions of the tumor containing cancer cells, cancer cells were coated with the chemokine, CXCL12, and the FAP+ CAF was the principal source of CXCL12 in the tumor. Administering AMD3100, a CXCL12 receptor chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 inhibitor, induced rapid T-cell accumulation among cancer cells and acted synergistically with $\alpha$-PD-L1 to greatly diminish cancer cells, which were identified by their loss of heterozygosity of Trp53 gene. The residual tumor was composed only of premalignant epithelial cells and inflammatory cells. Thus, a single protein, CXCL12, from a single stromal cell type, the FAP+ CAF, may direct tumor immune evasion in a model of human PDA.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The programmed death-1 ligand/programmed death-1 (PD-L/PD-1) pathway has been recently suggested to play a pivotal role in the immune evasion of tumors from host immune system. In this study, we tried to reveal the clinical importance and therapeutic potential of the PD-L/PD-1 pathway in pancreatic cancer, which is one of the most aggressive and intractable malignant tumors.
Experimental Design: We used immunohistochemistry to investigate PD-L expression in 51 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent surgery and explored the therapeutic efficacy of blocking the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway in murine pancreatic cancer in vivo.
Results: PD-L1\textendash{}positive patients had a significantly poorer prognosis than the PD-L1\textendash{}negative patients, whereas there was no significant correlation of tumor PD-L2 expression with patient survival. PD-L1 expression was inversely correlated with tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ T cells. These clinical data have suggested that the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway may be a critical regulator in human pancreatic cancer. Monoclonal antibodies against PD-L1 or PD-1 induced a substantial antitumor effect on murine pancreatic cancer in vivo. PD-L1 blockade promoted CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the tumor and induced local immune activation. Furthermore, the combination of anti\textendash{}PD-L1 monoclonal antibody and gemcitabine exhibited a significant synergistic effect on murine pancreatic cancer and resulted in complete response without overt toxicity.
Conclusion: Our data suggest for the first time that PD-L1 status may be a new predictor of prognosis for patients with pancreatic cancer and provide the rationale for developing a novel therapy of targeting the PD-L/PD-1 pathway against this fatal disease.},

In this study, we investigated the expression of PD-Ls in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to define their prognostic significance after curative surgery.
Experimental Design: Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate PD-Ls expression as well as granzyme B+ cytotoxic and FoxP3+ regulatory T cell infiltration on tissue microarrays containing 240 randomly selected HCC patients who underwent surgery. The results were further verified in an independent cohort of 125 HCC patients. PD-Ls expression on HCC cell lines was detected by Western blot assay.
Results: Patients with higher expression of PD-L1 had a significantly poorer prognosis than patients with lower expression. Although patients with higher expression of PD-L2 also had a poorer survival, the difference in recurrence was not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis identified tumor expression of PD-L1 as an independent predictor for postoperative recurrence. No correlation was found between PD-Ls expression and granzyme B+ lymphocyte infiltration, whereas a significant positive correlation was detected between PD-Ls expression and FoxP3+ lymphocyte infiltration. In addition, tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic and regulatory T cells were also independent prognosticators for both survival and recurrence. The prognostic value of PD-L1 expression was validated in the independent data set.
Conclusion: Our data suggest for the first time that PD-L1 status may be a new predictor of recurrence for HCC patients and provide the rationale for developing a novel therapy of targeting the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway against this fatal malignancy.},

The present study examined programmed death-1 ligand-1 (PD-L1) detected by immunohistochemical labeling in 102 cases of human gastric carcinoma, 10 adenoma and 10 normal tissues. The relationship between PD-L1 immunolocalization and clinical pathological features, as well as the prognosis of gastric carcinoma, was explored. There was no PD-L1 detectable in normal gastric tissues and very weak immunolabeling in gastric adenomas, but it could be detected in 42.2\% of gastric carcinoma tissues. There was no correlation between PD-L1 immunolocalization and patient age, sex, tumor location or the degree of tumor differentiation in the gastric carcinomas. However, PD-L1 immunodetection was significantly correlated to tumor size, invasion, lymph node metastasis and survival time of patients. PD-L1 immunolabeling was significantly enhanced (P$<$0.01) when the tumor infiltrated into the deep muscular layers, with lymph node metastasis or survival time of less than 2 years, Moreover, multivariate analysis demonstrated that PD-L1 immunodetection could be used as an independent factor to evaluate the prognosis of gastric carcinoma.},

  abstract = {Summary
Background
Expression of PD-L1 has been shown to be upregulated in some patients with gastric cancer. As part of the phase 1b KEYNOTE-012 study, we aimed to assess the safety and activity of the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1-positive recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction.
Methods
This study was a multicentre, open-label, phase 1b trial done at 13 cancer research centres in the USA, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. We enrolled patients with PD-L1-positive recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction. Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab at 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for 24 months or until progression or unacceptable toxic effects occurred. Response was assessed every 8 weeks in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. The primary objectives were safety in patients who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab and the proportion of patients achieving overall responses in patients who received at least one pembrolizumab dose and who either had a post-baseline scan or who discontinued therapy because of clinical disease progression or a treatment-related adverse event before the first post-baseline scan. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01848834, and is ongoing but no longer enrolling patients.
Findings
From Oct 23, 2013, to May 5, 2014, 39 patients were enrolled. 36 were evaluable for response by central assessment. Eight (22\%, 95\% CI 10\textendash{}39) patients were judged to have had an overall response at central review; all responses were partial. All 39 patients were included in the safety analyses. Five (13\%) patients had a total of six grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events, consisting of two cases of grade 3 fatigue, one case each of grade 3 pemphigoid, grade 3 hypothyroidism, and grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy, and one case of grade 4 pneumonitis. No treatment-related deaths occurred.
Interpretation
In this population of patients with recurrent or metastatic PD-L1-positive gastric cancer, pembrolizumab had a manageable toxicity profile and promising antitumour activity, warranting further study in phase 2 and 3 trials.

We assessed the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced gastric cancer in KEYNOTE-012 (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01848834).  Methods:  Archival tumor samples from patients from Asia-Pacific (AP) and rest of the world (ROW) with recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction were screened for PD-L1 expression using a prototype IHC assay with the 22C3 antibody. Only patients with distinctive stromal or $\geq$1\% tumor nest cell PD-L1 staining were eligible. Patients received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for up to 24 months or until complete response, progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Imaging was performed every 8 weeks. Primary efficacy end point is ORR assessed per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review. Secondary end points include duration of response, PFS, and OS.  Results: Of the 162 patientts screened, 65 (40\%) were PD-L1+. Of these 65 patients, 39 enrolled (19 from AP, 20 from ROW; median age, 63 years [range 33-78]). The number of prior therapies for advanced disease ranged from 0 to 5; 67\% received $\geq$2 prior therapies. Median follow-up duration was 8.8 months (range 6.2-12.6); 13 patients (33\%) remain on therapy. Four patients experienced 5 total grade 3-5 drug-related adverse events: peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue, decreased appetite, hypoxia, and pneumonitis (n = 1 each). There was 1 drug-related death (hypoxia). ORR was 22\% (95\% CI 10-39) by central review and 33\% (95\% CI 19-50) by investigator review. Median time to response was 8 weeks (range 7-16), with a median response duration of 24 weeks (range 8+ to 33+). PD-L1 expression level was associated with ORR (1-sided P = 0.10). The 6-month PFS rate was 24\%. The 6-month OS rate was 69\%.  Conclusions: Pembrolizumab demonstrated manageable toxicity and promising antitumor activity in advanced gastric cancer. These results support the ongoing development of pembrolizumab for gastric cancer. Clinical trial information: NCT01848834.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE:
To analyze glucose transporter 1 expression patterns in malignant tumors of various cell types and evaluate their diagnostic value by immunohistochemistry.

INTRODUCTION:
Glucose is the major source of energy for cells, and glucose transporter 1 is the most common glucose transporter in humans. Glucose transporter 1 is aberrantly expressed in several tumor types. Studies have implicated glucose transporter 1 expression as a prognostic and diagnostic marker in tumors, primarily in conjunction with positron emission tomography scan data.

METHODS:
Immunohistochemistry for glucose transporter 1 was performed in tissue microarray slides, comprising 1955 samples of malignant neoplasm from different cell types.

RESULTS:
Sarcomas, lymphomas, melanomas and hepatoblastomas did not express glucose transporter 1. Forty-seven per cent of prostate adenocarcinomas were positive, as were 29\% of thyroid, 10\% of gastric and 5\% of breast adenocarcinomas. Thirty-six per cent of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck were positive, as were 42\% of uterine cervix squamous cell carcinomas. Glioblastomas and retinoblastomas showed membranous glucose transporter 1 staining in 18.6\% and 9.4\% of all cases, respectively. Squamous cell carcinomas displayed membranous expression, whereas adenocarcinomas showed cytoplasmic glucose transporter 1 expression.

CONCLUSION:
Glucose transporter 1 showed variable expression in various tumor types. Its absence in sarcomas, melanomas, hepatoblastomas and lymphomas suggests that other glucose transporters mediate the glycolytic pathway in these tumors. The data suggest that glucose transporter 1 is a valuable immunohistochemical marker that can be used to identify patients for evaluation by positron emission tomography scan. The function of cytoplasmic glucose transporter 1 in adenocarcinomas must be further examined.},

  abstract = {Background: Hypoxia modifies the phenotype of tumors in a way that promotes tumor aggressiveness and resistance towards chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the expression and influence of hypoxia-regulated proteins on tumor biology are not well characterized in colorectal tumors. We studied the role of protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1$\alpha$, HIF-2$\alpha$, carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) in patients with colorectal adenocarcinomas. Methods: Expression of HIF-1$\alpha$, HIF-2$\alpha$, CA9 and GLUT1 was quantified by immunohistochemistry in 133 colorectal adenocarcinomas. The expression of hypoxia markers was correlated with clinicopathological variables and overall patient survival. Results: Expression of these hypoxia markers was detected in the epithelial compartment of the tumor cells as well as in tumor-associated stromal cells. Although tumor cells frequently showed expression of one or more of the investigated hypoxia markers, no correlation among these markers or with clinical response was found. However, within the tumor stroma, positive correlations between the hypoxia markers HIF-2$\alpha$, CA9 and GLUT1 were observed. Furthermore expression of HIF-2$\alpha$ and CA9 in tumor-associated stroma were both associated with a significantly reduced overall survival. In the Cox proportional hazard model, stromal HIF-2$\alpha$ expression was an independent prognostic factor for survival. Conclusion: These observations show, that expression of hypoxia regulated proteins in tumor-associated stromal cells, as opposed to their expression in epithelial tumor cells, is associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer. This study suggests that tumor hypoxia may influence tumor-associated stromal cells in a way that ultimately contributes to patient prognosis.},

  issn = {0167-8140},
  doi = {10.1016/j.radonc.2017.07.025},
  abstract = {Background and purpose
Hypoxia is a major cause of radio- and chemoresistance. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is an endogenous hypoxia-related marker and an important prognostic marker. Assessment of CAIX expression may allow patient selection for hypoxia or CAIX-targeted treatment. The radioactive tracer 111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 targets CAIX and can be used for SPECT imaging. Aim of this study was to validate and optimize 111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 for imaging of CAIX expression in head and neck tumor xenografts.
Material and methods
Affinity and internalization kinetics of 111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 were determined in vitro using CAIX-expressing SK-RC-52 cells. Tumor targeting characteristics were determined in athymic mice with six different head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCNij) xenografts. Tracer uptake was measured by ex vivo radioactivity counting. Intratumoral distribution of tracer uptake was measured using autoradiography and CAIX expression was determined immunohistochemically.
Results
26\% of the tracer was internalized into the SK-RC-52 cells within 24h. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 0.69$\pm$0.08nM. In biodistribution studies SCCNij153 tumors showed the highest tracer uptake: 4.1$\pm$0.8ID/g at 24h p.i. Immunohistochemical and autoradiographic analyses of the xenografts showed a distinct spatial correlation between localization of the tracer and CAIX expression.
Conclusion
111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 has a high affinity for CAIX. In vivo tumor uptake correlated strongly with CAIX expression in different head and neck xenografts. These results suggest that 111In-girentuximab-F(ab${'}$)2 is a promising tracer for imaging of hypoxia-related CAIX expression.},

  abstract = {We first show that the commonly used dimensionality reduction (DR) methods such as t-SNE and LargeVis poorly capture the global structure of the data in the low dimensional embedding. We show this via a number of tests for the DR methods that can be easily applied by any practitioner to the dataset at hand. Surprisingly enough, t-SNE performs the best w.r.t. the commonly used measures that reward the local neighborhood accuracy such as precision-recall while having the worst performance in our tests for global structure. We then contrast the performance of these two DR method against our new method called TriMap. The main idea behind TriMap is to capture higher orders of structure with triplet information (instead of pairwise information used by t-SNE and LargeVis), and to minimize a robust loss function for satisfying the chosen triplets. We provide compelling experimental evidence on large natural datasets for the clear advantage of the TriMap DR results. As LargeVis, TriMap scales linearly with the number of data points.},

In order to translate a continuous variable into a clinical decision, it is necessary to determine a cutoff point and to stratify patients into two groups each requiring a different kind of treatment. Currently, there is no standard method or standard software for biomarker cutoff determination. Therefore, we developed Cutoff Finder, a bundle of optimization and visualization methods for cutoff determination that is accessible online. While one of the methods for cutoff optimization is based solely on the distribution of the marker under investigation, other methods optimize the correlation of the dichotomization with respect to an outcome or survival variable. We illustrate the functionality of Cutoff Finder by the analysis of the gene expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) in breast cancer tissues. This distribution of these important markers is analyzed and correlated with immunohistologically determined ER status and distant metastasis free survival. Cutoff Finder is expected to fill a relevant gap in the available biometric software repertoire and will enable faster optimization of new diagnostic biomarkers.

  abstract = {We discuss an attentional model for simultaneous object tracking and recognition that is driven by gaze data. Motivated by theories of perception, the model consists of two interacting pathways: identity and control, intended to mirror the what and where pathways in neuroscience models. The identity pathway models object appearance and performs classification using deep (factored)-Restricted Boltzmann Machines. At each point in time the observations consist of foveated images, with decaying resolution toward the periphery of the gaze. The control pathway models the location, orientation, scale and speed of the attended object. The posterior distribution of these states is estimated with particle filtering. Deeper in the control pathway, we encounter an attentional mechanism that learns to select gazes so as to minimize tracking uncertainty. Unlike in our previous work, we introduce gaze selection strategies which operate in the presence of partial information and on a continuous action space. We show that a straightforward extension of the existing approach to the partial information setting results in poor performance, and we propose an alternative method based on modeling the reward surface as a Gaussian Process. This approach gives good performance in the presence of partial information and allows us to expand the action space from a small, discrete set of fixation points to a continuous domain.},

Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) is a humanized CD52-specific monoclonal antibody that produces profound T-cell depletion in humans and reduces the need for maintenance immunosuppression after renal transplantation. We therefore performed a study to determine if pretransplant T-cell depletion with alemtuzumab would induce tolerance in human renal allografts and to evaluate the nature of the alloimmune response in the setting of T-cell depletion.
        Methods.~Seven nonsensitized recipients of livingdonor kidneys were treated perioperatively with alemtuzumab and followed postoperatively without maintenance immunosuppression. Patients were evaluated clinically by peripheral flow cytometry, protocol biopsies evaluated immunohistochemically, and real-time polymerase chain reaction-based transcriptional analysis.
        Results.~Lymphocyte depletion was profound in the periphery and secondary lymphoid tissues. All patients developed reversible rejection episodes within the first month that were characterized by predominantly monocytic (not lymphocytic) infiltrates with only rare T cells in the peripheral blood or allograft. These episodes were responsive to treatment with steroids or sirolimus or both. After therapy, patients remained rejection-free on reduced immunosuppression, generally monotherapy sirolimus, despite the recovery of lymphocytes to normal levels.
        Conclusions.~T-cell depletion alone does not induce tolerance in humans. These data underscore a prominent role for early responding monocytes in human allograft rejection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thymic epithelial tumours are rare cancers for which new treatment options are required. Identification of putative predictive markers is important for developing clinical trials. We studied the expression of five putative predictive biomarkers, potentially actionable by approved experimental drugs.
METHODS: CD52, CD22, CD26, EG5, and IGF-1R expression were investigated by immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed surgical samples of thymic epithelial tumour patients. All samples containing 10\% positive epithelial tumour cells, independent of tumour cell intensity, were considered as positive. Correlation with histological subtype was performed.
RESULTS: 106 surgical samples (89 thymomas, 12 thymic carcinoma, and 5 thymic neuroendocrine tumours) were evaluated. Overall, CD52, CD22, CD26, EG5 and IGF-1R expression was observed in 7\%, 42\%, 25\%, 42\% and 77\% of samples, respectively. CD52 expression was more frequent in B2 and B3 thymoma. All TET subtypes stained for CD22, mainly AB thymoma (68\%). CD26 expression also correlated with AB thymoma (68\%), and A thymoma (50\%) subtype, while IGFR1 was the most common marker expressed by thymic carcinoma samples (92\%), followed by EG5 (60\%). Only EG5 expression was significantly higher in thymic carcinomas than in thymomas (75\% vs. 38\%, p=0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data were consistent with a previous study of IGF-1R expression. Based on their expression, activity of agents targeting CD52, CD 22, CD26 and EG5 could be further explored in TET patients.},

  abstract = {High immunohistochemical expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is found in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), but no studies have assessed CAIX in metastatic ccRCC (mccRCC) of the lung. As 75\% of patients with mccRCC show lung involvement, characterization of protein expression in these lesions is warranted. This investigation analyzed CAIX immunohistochemical expression in pulmonary/pleural tumors including mccRCC (n = 22), mesothelioma (n = 19), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 27), small cell carcinoma (n = 9), and adenocarcinoma (n = 49), as well as other mesothelial lesions (n = 4). Membranous immunoreactivity was semiquantitatively evaluated for percent of cells stained and intensity. All cases of mccRCC (1+, 4.5\%; 3+, 95.5\%) and mesothelioma (2+, 10.5\%; 3+, 89.5\%) expressed CAIX. Most cases of lung squamous cell carcinoma (0, 11.1\%; 1+, 25.9\%; 2+, 22.2\%; 3+, 40.7\%) and small cell carcinoma were reactive (0, 11.1\%; 1+, 22.2\%; 2+, 33.3\%; 3+, 33.3\%), while CAIX was detected less frequently in pulmonary adenocarcinoma (0, 61.2\%; 1+, 16.3\%; 2+, 12.2\%; 3+, 10.2\%). In addition, CAIX was positive in adenomatoid tumor (3+, 100\%) and mesothelial hyperplasia (3+, 100\%). We demonstrate that CAIX is sensitive for mccRCC within the lung and a novel immunohistochemical marker for mesothelial proliferations, notably mesothelioma. Variable immunoreactivity is present among primary pulmonary epithelial tumors. Knowledge of expression overlap between these entities may prevent an incorrect interpretation of immunohistochemical results, particularly when limited tissue is available. As new carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are being evaluated, testing additional tumors for CAIX may lead to novel treatment options.},

No significant correlation was observed in CA9 overexpression with tumor size, pT, stage and lymphovascular invasion. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas with CA9 overexpression showed better overall survival than that without expression (P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, lymph node metastasis (95\% CI: 2.103 (1.167-3.791), P = 0.013) was an independent poor prognostic factor. IHCC with CA9 overexpression showed a 0.5-fold (95\% confidence interval, 0.328-0.944) lower risk of death compared with those of no or weak expression.

MN/CA9 expression is limited to very few normal tissues. We have now extended those observations to further investigate expression of the MN/CA9 protein in histological sections and fine-needle aspiration biopsy smears of normal kidney, benign renal cell lesions, all categories of renal cell carcinomas (clear/granular/spindle cell, chromophilic cell, chromophobic cell, and collecting duct cell RCCs), metastatic RCCs, and non-renal cell clear cell adenocarcinomas. We have found that high levels of MN/CA9 expression is seen in all primary RCCs, cystic RCCs, and metastatic RCCs, with the exception of two cases of the chromophobe cell type, which were MN/CA9 negative. Identical MN/CA9 immunostaining was also observed in the aspiration cytological smears. In contrast, all benign lesions, including pyelonephritis, renal cysts, adenomas, oncocytomas, and normal kidney, did not express the MN/CA9 protein. Thus, we conclude that MN/CA9 protein expression could serve as a valuable adjunct to the cytological and histological diagnosis of benign renal cysts versus cystic RCC, adenoma versus RCC, and oncocytoma versus granular cell RCC. Diffuse membraneous staining of all RCCs (with the exception of chromophobic cell RCC) suggests that MN/CA9 protein expression might have an important clinical utility in the early detection and treatment of RCC. Absence of MN/CA9 expression in non-renal cell clear cell adenocarcinoma also indicates that MN/CA9 protein expression may be used as a differential diagnostic biomarker of metastatic clear cell RCC.},

  abstract = {A small subset of familial pancreatic endocrine tumors (PET) arises in patients with von Hippel\textendash{}Lindau syndrome and these tumors may have an adverse outcome compared to other familial PET. Sporadic PET rarely harbors somatic VHL mutations, but the chromosomal location of the VHL gene is frequently deleted in sporadic PET. A subset of sporadic PET shows active hypoxia signals on mRNA and protein level. To identify the frequency of functionally relevant VHL inactivation in sporadic PET and to examine a possible prognostic significance we correlated epigenetic and genetic VHL alterations with hypoxia signals. VHL mutations were absent in all 37 PETs examined. In 2 out of 35 informative PET (6\%) methylation of the VHL promoter region was detected and VHL deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization was found in 14 out of 79 PET (18\%). Hypoxia inducible factor 1$\alpha$ (HIF1-$\alpha$), carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA-9), and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) protein was expressed in 19, 27, and 30\% of the 152 PETs examined. Protein expression of the HIF1-$\alpha$ downstream target CA-9 correlated significantly with the expression of CA-9 RNA (P$<$0.001), VHL RNA (P$<$0.05), and VHL deletion (P$<$0.001) as well as with HIF1-$\alpha$ (P$<$0.005) and GLUT-1 immunohistochemistry (P$<$0.001). These PET with VHL alterations and signs of hypoxia signalling were characterized by a significantly shortened disease-free survival. We conclude that VHL gene impairment by promoter methylation and VHL deletion in nearly 25\% of PET leads to the activation of the HIF-pathway. Our data suggest that VHL inactivation and consecutive hypoxia signals may be a mechanism for the development of sporadic PET with an adverse outcome.},

As carbonic anhydrases (CA) 9 and 12 are induced by the low-oxygen environment within tumors, we investigated the relationship between the expression of these two CA and the presence of metastatic lymph nodes (LN) in uterine cervical cancer. CA9/CA12 expression was evaluated histochemically in primary cervical cancer tissues of 73 patients who underwent laparoscopic LN staging and two patients with clinical staging before definitive radiotherapy at the National Cancer Center, Korea. We also evaluated CA9 expression in 33 patients with pathologically confirmed metastatic LN. CA9 expression in the primary tumors was significantly associated with LN metastasis (P = 0.03) and poorer disease-free survival (relative risk, 6.1; 95\% confidence interval, 1.3\textendash{}28.3, P = 0.02, multivariate analysis), whereas CA12 expression did not show such a relationship. In addition, 21 of 24 metastatic LN revealed similar CA9 expression (P = 0.001), suggesting that CA9-expressing tumor cells had a higher metastatic potential. CA9 was expressed in 45 of 75 (60\%) primary tumors, with positive tumor cells observed predominantly in the area away from the blood vessels. In contrast, CA12 expression was observed in only 29 of 74 primary tumors (39\%), without a specific pattern. These findings indicate that expression of CA9, but not CA12, in tumors is associated with the presence of LN metastases and poorer prognosis. Selective application of new treatment modalities based on CA9 expression to prevent LN metastases may improve overall treatment outcome in patients with uterine cervical cancer.

  abstract = {Purpose: Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), encoded by the CD274 gene, is a target for immune checkpoint blockade; however, little is known about genomic CD274 alterations. A subset of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) exhibits increased copy number of chromosome 9p24, on which CD274 resides; however, most SCLCs show low expression of PD-L1. We therefore examined whether CD274 is a target of recurrent genomic alterations.
Experimental Design: We examined somatic copy number alterations in two patient cohorts by quantitative real-time PCR in 72 human SCLC cases (cohort 1) and SNP array analysis in 138 human SCLC cases (cohort 2). Whole-genome sequencing revealed the detailed genomic structure underlying focal amplification. PD-L1 expression in amplified cases from cohorts 1 and 2 was further examined by transcriptome sequencing and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining.
Results: By examining somatic copy number alterations in two cohorts of primary human SCLC specimens, we observed 9p24 copy number gains (where CD274 resides) and focal, high-level amplification of CD274. We found evidence for genomic targeting of CD274, suggesting selection during oncogenic transformation. CD274 amplification was caused by genomic rearrangements not affecting the open reading frame, thus leading to massively increased CD274 transcripts and high level expression of PD-L1.
Conclusions: A subset (4/210, 1.9\%) of human SCLC patient cases exhibits massive expression of PD-L1 caused by focal amplification of CD274. Such tumors may be particularly susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade. Clin Cancer Res; 23(5); 1220\textendash{}6. \textcopyright{}2016 AACR.},

  abstract = {Purpose
The immune checkpoint ligand programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed in various tumors and is associated with the response to anti programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 drugs. We evaluated PD-L1 expression in thymomas and thymic carcinomas to determine whether PD-L1 represents a therapeutic target in unresectable thymomas or thymic carcinomas that could be amenable to antibody-based immunotherapy.
Method
A tissue microarray (TMA) comprised of 101 thymomas and 38 thymic carcinomas samples was evaluated. After validation of the rabbit monoclonal PD-L1 antibody (clone E1L3N), the TMA was stained and the tumor PD-L1 expression score was calculated using a semiquantitive method (by multiplying the intensity [0\textendash{}3] by the staining area [0\textendash{}100\%]).
Results
Seventy percent of thymic carcinoma (type C) and 23\% of thymoma (types A, AB, and B) samples stained positive for PD-L1 (P\hspace{0.25em}$<$\hspace{0.25em}.001). A WHO classification (type C vs types A, AB, and B) was significantly associated with positive PD-L1 expression (P\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}0.006), though multivariate analysis did not show PD-L1 positive was a significant negative factor of overall survival (hazard ratio\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}0.99, 95\% confidence interval\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}0.35\textendash{}2.73; P\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}0.987).
Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest-scale study to evaluate PD-L1 expression in thymomas and thymic carcinomas. The data suggest that the anti PD-1/PD-L1 drug could be of potential use in immunotherapy for unresectable or relapsed thymomas and thymic carcinomas.},

Patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix or vulva have limited therapeutic options, and the potential for immunotherapy for this population has not been evaluated.

\subsubsection{Objective$<$/h3$>$

To determine the genetic status of\emph{CD274}(encoding PD-L1 [programmed cell death 1 ligand 1]) and\emph{PDCD1LG2}(encoding PD-L2 [programmed cell death 1 ligand 2]) in SCCs of the cervix and vulva and to correlate the findings with PD-L1 protein expression.$<$/p$>$

\subsubsection{Design, Setting, and Participants$<$/h3$>$

We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes targeting\emph{CD274},\emph{PDCD1LG2}, and the centromeric portion of chromosome 9, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using an antibody recognizing PD-L1 on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy specimens from 48 cervical SCCs and 23 vulvar SCCs.$<$/p$>$

\subsubsection{Main Outcomes and Measures$<$/h3$>$

Tumors were categorized according to the genetic abnormality in\emph{CD274}and\emph{PDCD1LG2}(coamplification \&gt; cogain \&gt; polysomy \&gt; disomy) as detected by FISH, and evaluated on a semiquantitative scale (modified H score, the product of the percentage of tumor cells with positive staining and the maximum intensity of positive staining) for PD-L1 protein expression as detected by IHC.$<$/p$>$

\subsubsection{Results$<$/h3$>$

Overall, 71 samples of FFPE tissue from cases of cervical SCCs (n = 48) and vulvar SCCs (n = 23) were retrieved from the archives of Brigham and Women's Hospital and included in this study. We observed cogain or coamplification of\emph{CD274}and\emph{PDCD1LG2}in 32 of 48 cervical SCCs (67\%) and 10 of 23 vulvar SCCs (43\%). Median PD-L1 protein expression was highest among tumors with\emph{CD274}and\emph{PDCD1LG2}coamplification and lowest among tumors with disomy.$<$/p$>$

\subsubsection{Conclusions and Relevance$<$/h3$>$

Recurrent copy number gain of the genes encoding the PD-1 ligands provides a genetic basis for PD-L1 expression in a subset of cervical and vulvar SCCs and identifies a class of patients that are rational candidates for therapies targeting PD-1.$<$/p$>$

  abstract = {There have been no major advances for the treatment of metastatic urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) in the last 30 years. Chemotherapy is still the standard of care. Patient outcomes, especially for those in whom chemotherapy is not effective or is poorly tolerated, remain poor1,2. One hallmark of UBC is the presence of high rates of somatic mutations3,4,5. These alterations may enhance the ability of the host immune system to recognize tumour cells as foreign owing to an increased number of antigens6. However, these cancers may also elude immune surveillance and eradication through the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; also called CD274 or B7-H1) in the tumour microenvironment7,8. Therefore, we examined the anti-PD-L1 antibody MPDL3280A, a systemic cancer immunotherapy, for the treatment of metastatic UBC. MPDL3280A is a high-affinity engineered human anti-PD-L1 monoclonal immunoglobulin-G1 antibody that inhibits the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 (PDCD1) and B7.1 (CD80)9. Because PD-L1 is expressed on activated T cells, MPDL3280A was engineered with a modification in the Fc domain that eliminates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity at clinically relevant doses to prevent the depletion of T cells expressing PD-L1. Here we show that MPDL3280A has noteworthy activity in metastatic UBC. Responses were often rapid, with many occurring at the time of the first response assessment (6 weeks) and nearly all were ongoing at the data cutoff. This phase I expansion study, with an adaptive design that allowed for biomarker-positive enriched cohorts, demonstrated that tumours expressing PD-L1-positive tumour-infiltrating immune cells had particularly high response rates. Moreover, owing to the favourable toxicity profile, including a lack of renal toxicity, patients with UBC, who are often older and have a higher incidence of renal impairment, may be better able to tolerate MPDL3280A versus chemotherapy. These results suggest that MPDL3280A may have an important role in treating UBC\textemdash{}the drug received breakthrough designation status by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2014.},

Recently, specific genotypic and phenotypic features have been linked to tumor cell immune escape mechanisms in PMBCL. We studied 571 B-cell lymphomas with a focus on PMBCL. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization here, we report that the programmed death ligand (PDL) locus (9p24.1) is frequently and specifically rearranged in PMBCL (20\%) as compared with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Rearrangement was significantly correlated with overexpression of PDL transcripts. Utilizing high-throughput sequencing techniques, we characterized novel translocations and chimeric fusion transcripts involving PDLs at base-pair resolution. Our data suggest that recurrent genomic rearrangement events underlie an immune privilege phenotype in a subset of B-cell lymphomas.},

  abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which unleash a patient's own T cells to kill tumors, are revolutionizing cancer treatment. To unravel the genomic determinants of response to this therapy, we used whole-exome sequencing of non\textendash{}small cell lung cancers treated with pembrolizumab, an antibody targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). In two independent cohorts, higher nonsynonymous mutation burden in tumors was associated with improved objective response, durable clinical benefit, and progression-free survival. Efficacy also correlated with the molecular smoking signature, higher neoantigen burden, and DNA repair pathway mutations; each factor was also associated with mutation burden. In one responder, neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses paralleled tumor regression, suggesting that anti\textendash{}PD-1 therapy enhances neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity. Our results suggest that the genomic landscape of lung cancers shapes response to anti\textendash{}PD-1 therapy.
More mutations predict better efficacy
Despite the remarkable success of cancer immunotherapies, many patients do not respond to treatment. Rizvi et al. studied the tumors of patients with non\textendash{}small-cell lung cancer undergoing immunotherapy. In two independent cohorts, treatment efficacy was associated with a higher number of mutations in the tumors. In one patient, a tumor-specific T cell response paralleled tumor regression.

  abstract = {PurposeWith prospective clinical sequencing of tumors emerging as a mainstay in cancer care, an urgent need exists for a clinical support tool that distills the clinical implications associated with specific mutation events into a standardized and easily interpretable format. To this end, we developed OncoKB, an expert-guided precision oncology knowledge base.MethodsOncoKB annotates the biologic and oncogenic effects and prognostic and predictive significance of somatic molecular alterations. Potential treatment implications are stratified by the level of evidence that a specific molecular alteration is predictive of drug response on the basis of US Food and Drug Administration labeling, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, disease-focused expert group recommendations, and scientific literature.ResultsTo date, $>$ 3,000 unique mutations, fusions, and copy number alterations in 418 cancer-associated genes have been annotated. To test the utility of OncoKB, we annotated all genomic events in 5,983 primary tumor samples in 19 cancer types. Forty-one percent of samples harbored at least one potentially actionable alteration, of which 7.5\% were predictive of clinical benefit from a standard treatment. OncoKB annotations are available through a public Web resource (http://oncokb.org) and are incorporated into the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics to facilitate the interpretation of genomic alterations by physicians and researchers.ConclusionOncoKB, a comprehensive and curated precision oncology knowledge base, offers oncologists detailed, evidence-based information about individual somatic mutations and structural alterations present in patient tumors with the goal of supporting optimal treatment decisions.},
