Abituzumab	CD51	humanized	ITGAV		mab	cancer	prostate	Prostate, Colon-Small_intestine	Abituzumab is a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeted at CD51 (an integrin) currently in development by Merck KGaA Darmstadt, Germany in an attempt to prevent bone lesion metastases in castration-resistant prostate cancer.[8] Cetixumab, a monoclonal antibody, that targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, can be used in combination as standard of care for treating colorectal cancer.[9][10][8] The Phase II portion of the trial sought to compare the efficacy of Abituzumab, cetuximab, and irinotecan compared to cetuximab and irinotecan in patients with KRAS (exon 2) wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.Based on the positive results of the Phase I trial, an additional Phase II clinical trial investigating Abituzumab's ability to extend progression free survival (PFS) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer was conducted.[11] This trial utilized Abituzumab in combination with luteinizing hormone antagonist/agonist treatment every three weeks in patients with confirmed bone lesions in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. During this study, the researchers did not see an overall improvement in prostate cancer, but they did observe a partial response in relation to the bone lesions. However, further study is warranted to determine the efficacy of Abituzumab in treating bone lesions in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

JTO 2010); adenocarcinoma represents approximately 85% of all non-squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. An overall survival benefit was not demonstrated in patients treated with bevacizumab; however, this may be due to the more limited use of bevacizumab as maintenance treatment in AVAiL versus E4599 (this differential effect is also apparent in the European vs US trials of bevacizumab in colorectal cancer: Tyagi and Grothey, Clin Colorectal Cancer, 2006). Another large European-based clinical trial with bevacizumab in lung cancer, AVAPERL, was reported in October 2011 (Barlesi, et al.Breast cancer[edit].In December 2010, the FDA removed the breast cancer indication from bevacizumab, saying that it had not been shown to be safe and effective in breast cancer patients. This only prevented Genentech from marketing bevacizumab for breast cancer. A panel of cancer experts ruled for a second time that Avastin, the best-selling cancer drug in the world, should no longer be used in breast cancer patients, clearing the way for the U. The committee concluded that breast cancer clinical studies of patients taking Avastin have shown no advantage in survival rates, no improvement in quality of life, and significant side effects. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency is revoking the agency’s approval of the breast cancer indication for bevacizumab after concluding that the drug has not been shown to be safe and effective for that use.Renal cancers[edit].In certain renal (kidney) cancers, bevacizumab improves the progression free survival time but not survival time. In 2009, the FDA approved bevacizumab for use in metastatic renal cell cancer (a form of kidney cancer).Bevacizumab slows tumor growth but does not affect overall survival in people with glioblastoma multiforme. In colon cancer, it is given in combination with the chemotherapy drug 5-FU (5-fluorouracil), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin or irinotecan.[29] In advanced lung cancer, less than half of patients qualify for treatment.[33] About 2/3 of cases involved patients with colorectal cancer, or patients with gastrointestinal perforations or fistulas.It received its first approval in the United States in 2004, for combination use with standard chemotherapy for metastatic colon cancer.[42] It has since been approved for use in certain lung cancers, renal cancers, ovarian cancers, and glioblastoma multiforme of the brain.At one point bevacizumab was approved for breast cancer by the FDA, but the approval was revoked on 18 November 2011.[43][44][45] The approval for breast cancer was revoked because, although there was evidence that it slowed progression of metastatic breast cancer, there was no evidence that it extended life or improved quality of life, and it caused adverse effects including severe high blood pressure and hemorrhaging. In 2008, the FDA gave bevacizumab provisional approval for metastatic breast cancer, subject to further studies.[46] In July 2010, after new studies failed to show a significant benefit, the FDA's advisory panel recommended against the indication for advanced breast cancer. The FDA ruled to withdraw the breast cancer indication in November 2011.[44] The drug remains approved for breast cancer use in other countries including Australia.[49] In 2006, the Scottish Medicines Consortium recommended against the NHS funding Avastin for first-line treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, due to estimated costs of £24,000 to £93,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).The addition of bevacizumab to standard treatment can prolong the lives of breast and lung cancer patients by several months, at a cost of $100,000 a year in the United States.[51] For colorectal cancer, Robert J.When bevacizumab is used in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), only tiny and relatively inexpensive doses (compared to amounts used in colon and other cancers) are required.Breast cancer approval[edit].In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration removed bevacizumab indication for metastatic breast cancer after concluding that the drug has not been shown to be safe and effective. The specific indication that was withdrawn was for the use of bevacizumab in metastatic breast cancer, with paclitaxel for the treatment of people who have not received chemotherapy for metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.In 2010, before the FDA announcement, The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) updated the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Breast Cancer to affirm the recommendation regarding the use of bevacizumab in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.In 2008, the FDA approved bevacizumab for use in breast cancer.On March 28, 2007, the European Commission approved bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer.A study released in April 2009 found that bevacizumab is not effective at preventing recurrences of non-metastatic colon cancer following surgery.Bevacizumab has demonstrated activity in ovarian cancer[66][67] and glioblastoma multiforme,[68] a type of brain tumour, when used as a single agent.In 2010, two phase III trials showed a 27% and 54% increase in progression-free survival in ovarian cancer.Bevacizumab has been investigated as a possible treatment of pancreatic cancer, as an addition to chemotherapy, but studies have shown no improvement in survival.As of 2012 clinical trials were underway to test an intra-arterial technique for delivering the drug directly to brain tumors, bypassing the blood–brain barrier.^ "Lessons From the Adjuvant Bevacizumab Trial on Colon Cancer: What Next?".^ "FDA begins process to remove breast cancer indication from Avastin label" (Press release).

FBTA05[71][72]	CD20	rat/mouse hybrid	MS4A1	Lymphomun	3funct	chronic lymphocytic leukaemia		Blood	Patients with B cell malignancies refractory to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) can be treated by subsequent immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). But unlike myeloid leukemia, B cell leukemia and lymphoma are less sensitive to allogeneic adoptive immunotherapy. Moreover, the beneficial graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effect may be associated with moderate to severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thus, novel therapeutic approaches augmenting the anti-tumor efficacy of DLI and dissociating the GVL effect from GVHD are needed. The anti-CD20 x anti-CD3 trifunctional bispecific antibody (trAb) FBTA05 may improve the targeting of tumor cells by redirecting immune allogeneic effector cells while reducing the risk of undesirable reactivity against normal host cells. Hence, FBTA05 may maximize GVL effects by simultaneously decreasing the incidence and severity of GVHD.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23815981

Pembrolizumab[119]		humanized	PDCD1		mab	melanoma and other cancers		Stomach, Colon-Small_intestine, Skin-Head, Lung, Breast, Ovary	The drug was initially used to treat metastatic melanoma.As of 2017, pembrolizumab is used via intravenous infusion to treat inoperable or metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in certain situations, as a second-line treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), after platinum-based chemotherapy, and for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL).[17] But then later in 2010 scientists from Bristol Myers Squibb published a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that their checkpoint inhibitor, ipilimumab (Yervoy) had shown strong promise in metastatic melanoma and that a second BMS checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, (Opdivo) was also promising.[17] As an example, Martin Huber was one of the few senior people at Merck with strong experience in lung cancer drug development, but had been promoted to senior management and was no longer involved in product development; he ended up stepping down from his role and led clinical development of pembrolizumab for lung cancer.[17] The phase I study started in early 2011, and Eric Rubin, who was running the melanoma trial, argued for and was able to win expansion of the trial until it reached around 1300 people roughly divided between melanoma and lung cancer, the largest Phase I study ever run in oncology.On October 2, 2015, the FDA approved pembrolizumab for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 and who have failed treatment with other chemotherapeutic agents.In July 2016, the US FDA accepted for priority review an application for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) after a platinum-based chemotherapy,[25] and gave an accelerated approval on August 9, 2016.In August 2016, the FDA granted an accelerated approval to pembrolizumab as a treatment for patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) ("regardless of PD-L1 staining") following progression on a platinum-based chemotherapy, based on objective response rates (ORR) in the phase Ib KEYNOTE-012 study.In May 2017, pembrolizumab received an accelerated approval from the FDA for use in any unresectable or metastatic solid tumor with DNA mismatch repair deficiencies or a microsatellite instability-high state (or, in the case of colon cancer, tumors that have progressed following chemotherapy). Ninety patients had colorectal cancer, and 59 patients had one of 14 other cancer types. Response rates were similar across all cancer types, including 36% in colorectal cancer and 46% across the other tumor types.In 2015, Merck reported results in 13 cancer types; much attention was given to early results in head and neck cancer.As of May 2016, pembrolizumab was in Phase IB clinical trials for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), gastric cancer, urothelial cancer, and head and neck cancer (all under the "Keynote-012" trial) and in Phase II trial for TNBC (the "Keynote-086" trial).

Pertuzumab	HER2/neu	humanized	ERBB2	Omnitarg	mab	cancer		Lung, Ovary, Skin-Head, Prostate, Breast	Pertuzumab (also called 2C4, trade name Perjeta)[1] is a monoclonal antibody used in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the treatment of metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer; it also used in the same combination as a neoadjuvant in early HER2-positive breast cancer.Pertuzumab is administered as an intravenous infusion in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel as a first line treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.[2][3] It is also used in the same combination as a neoadjuvant (given to reduce the size of a tumor, prior to surgery or radiation) for HER2-positive early breast cancer; as of 2016 this use had not been shown to increase survival.In clinical trials of the three-agent combination therapy in metastatic breast cancer, adverse effects occurring in more than half the people taking it included diarrhea, hair loss, and loss of neutrophils; more than 10% of people experienced loss of neutrophils with fever, and loss of leukocytes. HER2 positive breast cancer is caused by mutation that results in overexpression of HER2 in approximately 15-30% of breast cancer tumors.In 2005 Genentech presented poor results of Phase II trials of pertuzumab as a single agent in prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers, and said that it intended to continue developing it in combination with other drugs for ovarian cancer.In 2012 the results were published of the CLEOPATRA trial, a randomized placebo-controlled Phase III trial of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.[18] Pertuzumab received US FDA approval for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer later that year.Pertuzumab had also been studied in Non-small cell lung cancer but as of 2016 that indication had been discontinued.[23][24][25] This decision was subsequently reversed six months later and pertuzumab became the first new breast cancer drug to be approved by NICE for routine NHS funding in almost a decade after Roche pledged to provide the drug to the NHS at an undisclosed discount for patients in the neoadjuvant setting and to share the long–term financial risks.

A mechanism of resistance involves failure to downregulate p27 (Kip1) [15] as well as suppressing p27 translocation to the nucleus in breast cancer, enabling cdk2 to induce cell proliferation.The HER2 gene (also known as HER2/neu and ErbB2 gene) is amplified in 20–30% of early-stage breast cancers[15] Trastuzumab activates p27 by simultaneously inhibiting PI3K/Akt, Mirk and hKIS pathways,[15] which makes it overexpress epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors in the cell membrane. In some cancers, notably certain types of breast cancer, HER2 is over-expressed and causes cancer cells to reproduce uncontrollably.[15] Trastuzumab has been shown to inhibit HER2/neu ectodomain cleavage in breast cancer cells. If the breast cancer does not overexpress HER2, trastuzumab will have no beneficial effect (and may cause harm).One of the challenges in the treatment of breast cancer patients by herceptin is our understanding towards herceptin resistance.[43] This database HerceptinR is a collection of assays performed to test sensitivity or resistance of Herceptin Antibodies towards breast cancer cell lines.Since October 2006 trastuzumab has been made available for Australian women and men with early stage breast cancer via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
