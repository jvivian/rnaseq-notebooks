0	Alemtuzumab[12]	Lemtrada, Campath	mab	humanized	CD52	Multiple sclerosis	1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Campath is indicated as a single agent for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Campath is a CD52-directed cytolytic antibody indicated as a single agent for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) (1).	12.1 Mechanism of Action Campath binds to CD52, an antigen present on the surface of B and T lymphocytes, a majority of monocytes, macrophages, NK cells, and a subpopulation of granulocytes. A proportion of bone marrow cells, including some CD34+ cells, express variable levels of CD52. The proposed mechanism of action is antibody-dependent cellular-mediated lysis following cell surface binding of Campath to the leukemic cells.

1	Atezolizumab[20]		mab	humanized	CD274	cancer	1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE TECENTRIQ is a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody indicated for the treatment of patients with: Locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who: are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression during or following any platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. (1.1) This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. (1.1) Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving TECENTRIQ. (1.2) 1.1 Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who: are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression during or following any platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 1.2 Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer TECENTRIQ is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving TECENTRIQ [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].	12.1 Mechanism of Action PD-L1 may be expressed on tumor cells and/or tumor-infiltrating immune cells and can contribute to the inhibition of the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors found on T cells and antigen presenting cells suppresses cytotoxic T-cell activity, T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. This releases the PD-L1/PD-1 mediated inhibition of the immune response, including activation of the anti-tumor immune response without inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-L1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.

The EGFR is constitutively expressed in many normal epithelial tissues, including the skin and hair follicle. Expression of EGFR is also detected in many human cancers including those of the head and neck, colon, and rectum. Cetuximab binds specifically to the EGFR on both normal and tumor cells, and competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands, such as transforming growth factor-alpha. In vitro assays and in vivo animal studies have shown that binding of cetuximab to the EGFR blocks phosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases, resulting in inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, and decreased matrix metalloproteinase and vascular endothelial growth factor production. Signal transduction through the EGFR results in activation of wild-type Ras proteins, but in cells with activating Ras somatic mutations, the resulting mutant Ras proteins are continuously active regardless of EGFR regulation. In vitro, cetuximab can mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against certain human tumor types. In vitro assays and in vivo animal studies have shown that cetuximab inhibits the growth and survival of tumor cells that express the EGFR. No anti-tumor effects of cetuximab were observed in human tumor xenografts lacking EGFR expression. The addition of cetuximab to radiation therapy or irinotecan in human tumor xenograft models in mice resulted in an increase in anti-tumor effects compared to radiation therapy or chemotherapy alone.

16	Durvalumab[53]		mab	human	CD274	cancer	1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE IMFINZI is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who: •have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. •have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. IMFINZI is a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody indicated for the treatment of patients with: •Locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who: •have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. (1) •have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. (1) This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. (1)	12.1 Mechanism of Action Expression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) can be induced by inflammatory signals (e.g., IFN-gamma) and can be expressed on both tumor cells and tumor-associated immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and activation through interaction with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). By binding to its receptors, PD-L1 reduces cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation, and cytokine production. Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions releases the inhibition of immune responses, without inducing antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). PD-L1 blockade with durvalumab led to increased T-cell activation in vitro and decreased tumor size in co-engrafted human tumor and immune cell xenograft mouse models.

17	Gemtuzumab ozogamicin	Mylotarg	mab	humanized	CD33	acute myelogenous leukemia	1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE MYLOTARG is a CD33-directed antibody-drug conjugate indicated for: treatment of newly-diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults (1.1). treatment of relapsed or refractory CD33-positive AMLin adults and in pediatric patients 2 years and older (1.2). 1.1 Newly-Diagnosed CD33-positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) MYLOTARG is indicated for the treatment of newly-diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia in adults. 1.2 Relapsed or Refractory CD33-positive AML MYLOTARG is indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia in adults and in pediatric patients 2 years and older.	12.1 Mechanism of Action Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a CD33-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The antibody portion (hP67.6) recognizes human CD33 antigen. The small molecule, N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin, is a cytotoxic agent that is covalently attached to the antibody via a linker. Nonclinical data suggest that the anticancer activity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is due to the binding of the ADC to CD33-expressing tumor cells, followed by internalization of the ADC-CD33 complex, and the intracellular release of N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide via hydrolytic cleavage of the linker. Activation of N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide induces double-strand DNA breaks, subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death.

18	Ipilimumab[45]	Yervoy	mab	human	CD152	melanoma	1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE YERVOY is a human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)-blocking antibody indicated for: •Treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adults and pediatric patients (12 years and older). (1.1) •Adjuvant treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathologic involvement of regional lymph nodes of more than 1 mm who have undergone complete resection, including total lymphadenectomy. (1.2) 1.1 Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma YERVOY is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adults and pediatric patients (12 years and older) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 1.2 Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma YERVOY is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathologic involvement of regional lymph nodes of more than 1 mm who have undergone complete resection, including total lymphadenectomy [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].	12.1 Mechanism of Action CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response.

19	Necitumumab[105]		mab	human	EGFR	non-small cell lung carcinoma	1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE PORTRAZZA™ is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist indicated, in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin, for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer. (1.1) Limitation of Use: PORTRAZZA is not indicated for treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. (1.2, 5.6, 14.2) 1.1 Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) PORTRAZZA™ is indicated, in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin, for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer. 1.2 Limitation of Use PORTRAZZA is not indicated for treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].	12.1 Mechanism of Action Necitumumab is a recombinant human lgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and blocks the binding of EGFR to its ligands. Expression and activation of EGFR has been correlated with malignant progression, induction of angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis. Binding of necitumumab induces EGFR internalization and degradation in vitro. In vitro, binding of necitumumab also led to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in EGFR-expressing cells. In in vivo studies using xenograft models of human cancer, including non-small cell lung carcinoma, administration of necitumumab to implanted mice resulted in increased antitumor activity in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin as compared to mice receiving gemcitabine and cisplatin alone.

Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth. Combined nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) mediated inhibition results in enhanced T-cell function that is greater than the effects of either antibody alone, and results in improved anti-tumor responses in metastatic melanoma. In murine syngeneic tumor models, dual blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 resulted in increased anti-tumor activity.

Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth. Combined nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) mediated inhibition results in enhanced T-cell function that is greater than the effects of either antibody alone, and results in improved anti-tumor responses in metastatic melanoma. In murine syngeneic tumor models, dual blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 resulted in increased anti-tumor activity.

25	Obinutuzumab	Gazyva	mab	humanized	CD20	Chronic lymphatic leukemia	1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE GAZYVA (obinutuzumab) is a CD20-directed cytolytic antibody and is indicated: in combination with chlorambucil, for the treatment of patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. (1, 14) in combination with bendamustine followed by GAZYVA monotherapy, for the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) who relapsed after, or are refractory to, a rituximab-containing regimen. (1, 14) 1.1 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia GAZYVA, in combination with chlorambucil, is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 1.2 Follicular Lymphoma GAZYVA, in combination with bendamustine followed by GAZYVA monotherapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) who relapsed after, or are refractory to, a rituximab-containing regimen [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].	12.1 Mechanism of Action Obinutuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen expressed on the surface of pre B- and mature B-lymphocytes. Upon binding to CD20, obinutuzumab mediates B-cell lysis through (1) engagement of immune effector cells, (2) by directly activating intracellular death signaling pathways (direct cell death), and/or (3) activation of the complement cascade. The immune effector cell mechanisms include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. As an antibody with reduced fucose content, obinutuzumab induces greater ADCC activity than rituximab in vitro using human cancer cell lines. Obinutuzumab also demonstrated an increased ability to induce direct cell death when compared to rituximab. Obinutuzumab binds to FcγRIII using purified proteins with a higher affinity than rituximab. Obinutuzumab and rituximab bind with similar affinity to overlapping epitopes on CD20.

The CD20 molecule is expressed on normal B lymphocytes (pre–B- to mature B-lymphocyte) and on B-cell CLL. The CD20 molecule is not shed from the cell surface and is not internalized following antibody binding. The Fab domain of ofatumumab binds to the CD20 molecule and the Fc domain mediates immune effector functions to result in B-cell lysis in vitro. Data suggest that possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

(1.1, 14.2) As monotherapy following disease progression after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy. (1.1, 14.1) Limitation of Use: Vectibix is not indicated for the treatment of patients with RAS-mutant mCRC or for whom RAS mutation status is unknown. (1.1, 2.1, 5.2, 12.1) 1.1 Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Vectibix is indicated for the treatment of patients with wild-type RAS (defined as wild-type in both KRAS and NRAS as determined by an FDA-approved test for this use) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) [see Dos age and Administration ( 2.1 )] : • As first-line therapy in combination with FOLFOX [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . • As monotherapy following disease progression after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Limitation of Use: Vectibix is not indicated for the treatment of patients with RAS-mutant mCRC or for whom RAS mutation status is unknown [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ].	12.1 Mechanism of Action The EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is a member of a subfamily of type I receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4. EGFR is constitutively expressed in normal epithelial tissues, including the skin and hair follicle. EGFR is overexpressed in certain human cancers, including colon and rectum cancers. Interaction of EGFR with its normal ligands (e.g., EGF, transforming growth factor-alpha) leads to phosphorylation and activation of a series of intracellular proteins, which in turn regulate transcription of genes involved with cellular growth and survival, motility, and proliferation. KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homologue) and NRAS (Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homologue) are highly related members of the RAS oncogene family. Signal transduction through the EGFR can result in activation of the wild-type KRAS and NRAS proteins; however, in cells with activating RAS somatic mutations, the RAS-mutant proteins are continuously active and appear independent of EGFR regulation. Panitumumab binds specifically to EGFR on both normal and tumor cells, and competitively inhibits the binding of ligands for EGFR. Nonclinical studies show that binding of panitumumab to the EGFR prevents ligand-induced receptor autophosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases, resulting in inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased proinflammatory cytokine and vascular growth factor production, and internalization of the EGFR. In vitro assays and in vivo animal studies demonstrate that panitumumab inhibits the growth and survival of selected human tumor cell lines expressing EGFR.

As a result, pertuzumab inhibits ligand-initiated intracellular signaling through two major signal pathways, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Inhibition of these signaling pathways can result in cell growth arrest and apoptosis, respectively. In addition, pertuzumab mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). While pertuzumab alone inhibited the proliferation of human tumor cells, the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab augmented anti-tumor activity in HER2-overexpressing xenograft models.

Non-progressing (including stable disease), follicular lymphoma as a single agent after first-line cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy. 1.2 Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) RITUXAN HYCELA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. 1.3 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) RITUXAN HYCELA is indicated, in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC), for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated and previously treated CLL. 1.4 Limitations of Use Initiate treatment with RITUXAN HYCELA only after patients have received at least one full dose of a rituximab product by intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. RITUXAN HYCELA is not indicated for the treatment of non-malignant conditions.	12.1 Mechanism of Action Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen expressed on the surface of pre-B and mature B-lymphocytes. Upon binding to CD20, rituximab mediates B-cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Hyaluronan is a polysaccharide found in the extracellular matrix of the subcutaneous tissue. It is depolymerized by the naturally occurring enzyme hyaluronidase. Unlike the stable structural components of the interstitial matrix, hyaluronan has a half-life of approximately 0.5 days. Hyaluronidase human increases permeability of the subcutaneous tissue by temporarily depolymerizing hyaluronan. In the doses administered, hyaluronidase human in RITUXAN HYCELA acts locally. The effects of hyaluronidase human are reversible and permeability of the subcutaneous tissue is restored within 24 to 48 hours. Hyaluronidase human has been shown to increase the absorption rate of a rituximab product into the systemic circulation when given in the subcutis of Göttingen Minipigs.

Patients should have either: Received prior therapy for metastatic disease, or Developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant therapy. KADCYLA is a HER2-targeted antibody and microtubule inhibitor conjugate indicated, as a single agent, for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination. Patients should have either: Received prior therapy for metastatic disease, or Developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant therapy. (1)	12.1 Mechanism of Action Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate. The antibody is the humanized anti-HER2 IgG1, trastuzumab. The small molecule cytotoxin, DM1, is a microtubule inhibitor. Upon binding to sub-domain IV of the HER2 receptor, ado-trastuzumab emtansine undergoes receptor-mediated internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation, resulting in intracellular release of DM1-containing cytotoxic catabolites. Binding of DM1 to tubulin disrupts microtubule networks in the cell, which results in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that similar to trastuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine inhibits HER2 receptor signaling, mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and inhibits shedding of the HER2 extracellular domain in human breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2.
